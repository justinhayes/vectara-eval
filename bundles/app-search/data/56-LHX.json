So just wanted to mention that. But in terms of my question, in the letter, you talked about analyzing the situation over the next few months prior to providing 2023 guidance.

That launch is looking good for mid-2023. So while we may not recognize revenue upon launch, I just want to highlight the cadence in the volume and the speed in which we're working. And just looking at the manifest the other day, we have about 40 spacecraft scheduled to be launched in the next 24 months. So that gives you an idea of how we're doing in the space world. We talked historically about some of the airborne headwind, using that as kind of a proxy for F-35 which decreased in 2022 compared to 2021. I think like everybody else on the program, we're kind of seeing a leveling off. So we will not have that headwind.

I think we all tend to talk about supply chain as a homogeneous entity. But, as you know, it's much more fragmented.

So that's a little bit different than others within the industry. So as you think about some of the supply chain constraints and the deferrals associated with it, it really is the entirety of the revenue being recognized versus over like a cost incurred type of revenue recognition. Also, this is our higher-margin business. It runs about 25% for us. So again, to Chris' point, this is more reflective of deferred revenue versus lost. But just to give a little bit more color in terms of margins, how it's playing out in 2022 and how we're thinking about 2023, to Chris' opening comments, we did reduce our guide to 15.5 from an overall segment perspective, really driven by two things. One was around the volume mix, in terms operating aircraft missionization along with the supply chain constraints, these tend to be margin accretive for us across our own portfolio.

So it almost becomes the norm. But I still hold out hope that we can have a budget in a timely manner. So to your point, specifically, on the CR, we do have an election upcoming as we know, in November. So we'll see how that plays out. And I'm hopeful that we have a budget and the conference occurs in December. But when you look at the total debt that's accumulating in our country, you look at the debt ceilings, many of us were around and remember sequestration and Budget Control Act and all those things that are looming out there does give me concern. The PBR was $773 billion. And we have the different markups from 777 to 819 and a couple of things in between. So there has to be a conference.

And I'll say, I think we have control over the situation but let me explain the complexities as we were reviewing this a week or so ago. And I'll just use TCOM as an example. So in the quarter, we delivered about 12,000 radios. And you've heard me say and Michelle say and we'll probably continue to say, we don't book the revenue, the profit until we make the delivery. So they were split between manpack radios call it, 8,000 manpacks and 4,000 handheld radios. And when you go down into the details and we looked at the schematics, talk to the team, I think Michelle was just up there a few weeks ago at a KIA event on supply chain that we hosted.

But I said in my prepared comments, if you don't have all the parts, you can't deliver a radio. You can deliver an airplane with missing parts. You can deliver a ship with missing parts and you deliver a lot of things with missing parts but you can't deliver a radio or arguably night vision goggles or cameras. So, I think that's what's unique. And the question got to be, do we know what the heck we're doing here which this is a fair question, you didn't ask that but I'm sure that's on people's minds.

So this happens on a regular basis. We're leveraging DPAS. Like I said, we have executive outreach. We have contacts. We look at this daily. But that's an example of maybe it's down in the weeds but that's what we're tracking, 100 million parts for one entity for one quarter and that's how we came up where we are.

So although we're disappointed that we're not getting to the ramp that we originally had anticipated, we are seeing improvement from where we started having this acute pain point in Q3 of last year versus where we're at today. The other thing I would highlight is we continue to see really strong demand across communication systems, particularly within our TCOM business. Chris noted the record $5 billion bookings that we had within the quarter that was led from Tactical Communications. And then if you look at our backlog, it continues to grow.

And our challenge is getting our arms around expectations for 2023 with the recognition that we continue to see volatility even within a quarter, particularly within our short-cycle businesses like communication systems. One thing I do just want to highlight because I want to give huge -- Chris noted that I was up in Rochester at an AIA event a few weeks ago. I want to give props to the Rochester TCOM team.
