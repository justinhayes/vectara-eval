Our position now as the things have materially changed, we've seen that impacting our capital markets business directly. We are getting hit harder and faster than we were expecting 90 days ago and we're expecting the recession to impact our business for longer than we did 90 days ago.

In Q3 and we have this on Slide 7 as you as you all saw, I think it's always important to look at our advisory margin excluding OMSRs, that was 30 basis points of the decline, that OMSRs are peer margins, but when they grow, they're adding margin and when they decline 100% of that margin comes out. The second is, we are in because of the phenomenal first half of the year we had and the exceptional growth we delivered, our producers entered higher tranches much earlier than they ever have before. So that was 80 basis points of the margin decline. And those tranches reset at the end of the year.

We are under invested in 2021 simply because revenue accelerated faster than we can pick up our investments and then we also increased -- we have wage inflation just as every other company had.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 2, \"speaker\": \"Emma Giamartino\", \"section_number\": 4, \"uuid\": \"1e67e0fa-4727-4553-b4fa-09f10d5398e7\", \"speaker_title\": \"Global Group President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer at CBRE Group\"}"}, {"id": 10, "text": "So going forward, what we're seeing looking into Q4, we should expect that operating expense growth to continue to come down.

In Q3, our operating expenses came down to 10% growth year-over-year and in Q4 our operating expense should decline year-over-year and this is within Advisory. And that's -- there's two components to how those costs are coming out. One is our discretionary cost levers that we can pull going back on travel and entertainment, continuing to pull back on new hires.

We believe that when interest rates start to go the other direction, when the Fed reverse course because they think that the economy has gotten to a point where continued upward pressure on interest rates goes from being at the problem solving circumstance to a problem creating circumstance that we will see that pipeline start to transact and it will recover.
