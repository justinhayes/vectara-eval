As we've talked about many, many times, we don't really participate widely in travel and entertainment. And as a result of that, we're not really seeing the strength of the recovery coming in those channels, which I know is driving a good portion of volume growth kind of across the sector.

So part of what we've liked about our strategy now for quite some time is the fact that by owning these underlying software capabilities and solutions, we control the ability to export them to markets outside of the US, again, to drive distinction and differentiation in these markets as they continue to evolve. So I think that is a -- it's a unique sort of positioning for Global Payments and one that we're particularly excited about.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Cameron Bready\", \"section_number\": 55, \"uuid\": \"d894fc55-8d44-4cf8-ac28-76afa63f3fd7\", \"speaker_title\": \"President and Chief Operating Officer at Global Payments\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Jeff Sloan", "id": 119, "section": [{"id": 120, "text": "I'd also say, Bob, just to circle back to complete the question. On the issuer side, the cloud sales. So look, when we announced the deal, the unique partnership we have with AWS two and a quarter [Phonetic] kind of years ago now. We are very excited, but probably uncertain about the timeline, the path of migration, traditional financial infusions, we're not uncertain about that anymore. I mean, I think now that the world has reopened, I think I've been in Europe, three times for work along with Gaylon in the last few months and that with most of the top financial institutions in the United States, in Canada and most of Western Europe. As I mentioned a minute ago, in addition to the $75 million accounts and implementation for accounts on file, I don't think we've ever had the bucket of opportunities that we have today on the issuer side. And every one of those RFPs comes in and says we want 100% cloud kind of the first day. So I would just say in terms of other areas of focus on the issuing side beyond B2B and both beyond what we've already described, I think the cloud sales and in particular, I think the AWS cloud sales.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Jeff Sloan\", \"section_number\": 56, \"uuid\": \"ca321b31-2110-47b9-8b10-e5e824ac42f9\", \"speaker_title\": \"Chief Executive Officer at Global Payments\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Robert Napoli", "id": 121, "section": [{"id": 122, "text": "Thanks. And maybe that's just my follow-up. Issuer, you talked about a number of takeaways quite a few takeaways. How much of that is driven by cloud versus -- I mean pricing, you have a lot of scale, so you have high incremental margins. But what's driving what seems to be an acceleration in takeaways in issue?", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Robert Napoli\", \"section_number\": 57, \"uuid\": \"aa7790e9-f197-4666-a04e-5051cdc05c5c\", \"speaker_title\": \"Analyst at William Blair\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Jeff Sloan", "id": 123, "section": [{"id": 124, "text": "Yeah, I think it's really, Bob, led by technology. So we really have a technology and product-centric first view of the world. I also think we have excellent people both on the sales and support side and we hear that consistently from our financial institution partners. So listen, as it relates to pricing, I think as with all things in life, you have to be competitive. These are big, smart, sophisticated institutions that run our fees. But at the end of the day, I think it's really driven by the product stack and the technology stack. And I think public cloud or table stakes now in that environment, also dovetails very nicely with our go-to-market on the B2B side, which is also obviously with MineralTree, very cloud-centric.
