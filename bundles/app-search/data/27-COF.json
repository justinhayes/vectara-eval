Let me just pull up and just comment on normalization. First of all the context of where we are because consumer credit remains strong as you can see from the metrics. And, our Domestic Card losses in the third quarter were about half of pre-pandemic levels and our delinquencies are and we've often said this, unmistakably normalizing but right now, they remain about 20% below pre pandemic levels. There is not a certain point where we don't look out there and see if the rate of growth of delinquencies exceeds a certain number then we will pull back but let me comment first of all that we've said for a long-time, Kevin and I know you know this that normalization is bound to happen, it would be shocking if it didn't happen and, we've been talking for a bunch of quarters now saying it started, you needed a magnifying Glass to see it and we talked about that and now of course you can see it in the numbers and, it's definitely normalizing. The rate at which it's normalizing is frankly more gradual than we generally expected but we didn't have a road map to know exactly what pace it would normalize. We just have believed so strongly that it would. So what we do with it rather than say there is a certain number that would lead us to make certain decision, we of course look at this, with what's happening with every segment and micro segment of our business and how it's performing. We look for starters at the back-book and that is normalizing as--well, frankly, like everything here more gradually than expected but still the back-book is clearly normalizing as well. We then look for other patterns of normalization. And, here are some of the patterns that we see, Kevin. It's more pronounced in the front book of new originations than in the existing back-book and by the way that would be shocking if it weren't the case because 100% of the time in our history, front books normalize faster during periods of change but we confirm again that front books are normalizing faster. It also seems that normalization is more pronounced at the lower-end of the market and, of course, those are the populations that improved more and more quickly earlier in the pandemic. Lower income consumers may also be feeling more pressure from inflation so these trends shouldn't be surprising. But at kind of a high-level what we see is very normal and basically the way we're leaning into the marketplace, it is very consistent with what we've been see33ing for a bunch of quarters now. But what we do at the micro-level, at the segment level and the sub-segment level, is look at the various metrics, both on the back-book and on the front book to see what the patterns are and we're comfortable with what we see in terms of front book vintage curves as a general point and across a vast majority of all the segments that we operate in. Around the edges we've done a little bit of dialing back-in particular pockets where metrics are normalizing a little bit faster. We also sort of pull up and say what are the kinds of--what are the risks that we would expect to see at a time like this with orthogonal looks through our book and we brainstorm on what other risk we could see, we go hunt for them and in a couple of places we have seen affects that cause a little bit of trimming around the edges but the collective amount of trimming in the card business is pretty small relative to the overall scale of our growth. As you know, in the auto business we have pulled back. At the very same time we're leaning into the card business, we're pulling back-in the auto business but maybe I'll save that for another question.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Rich Fairbank\", \"section_number\": 2, \"uuid\": \"13e0a603-7422-4bd5-9e43-1df030e51b13\", \"speaker_title\": \"Chief Executive Officer at Capital One Financial\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Kevin Barker", "id": 5, "section": [{"id": 6, "text": "Okay, Just a follow-up.

And we know that investing in technology modernization and driving for efficiency improvements are on a shared path. Technology investment helps our revenue growth and helps drive productivity improvement. And beneath the surface of the high level of investment has been significant productivity gains from modernizing our tech stack, eliminating legacy, vendor costs, driving customers to digital and driving more automation in the company. And at the same time of course we have continued to lean into this technology journey and the opportunities that it generates and so it's a very shared path and I think that our guidance for modest improvement in 2023 is a reflection of continued traction in growth and operating productivity while also continuing to invest in future opportunities.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Rich Fairbank\", \"section_number\": 11, \"uuid\": \"863592db-23e8-4c0d-aea0-fe8d0d63d0e2\", \"speaker_title\": \"Chief Executive Officer at Capital One Financial\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Ryan Nash", "id": 22, "section": [{"id": 23, "text": "Got it.

Recall it's probably helpful to start with a little bit of history here. And you'll recall our NIM was compressed during the pandemic, largely driven by a balance sheet that was skewed much more towards cash and securities than card loans. And as we progressed over the course of the pandemic, you saw that begin to normalize and so just by way of evidence a year ago our NIM was, I think 635 I'd said in my prepared remarks and at that point card was closer to 27%, I think of our interest-earning assets and cash and securities was something like 33. Cards now shifted to be just over 30% and cash and securities are down to 27, so I share that to say we are now operating much closer to our pre-pandemic balance sheet mix and our NIM is roughly in a similar spot to where it was before the pandemic, so to your question then about rate risk you can see in our Q--our rate risk disclosures we're really only slightly asset sensitive at this point and keep in mind that's relative to forwards, so the 150 basis points projected moves over the next couple of months. We're already sort of embedded in that neutral baseline and so as I think about the future there's a number of things that can impact NIM, not to mention seasonality but the credit impacts on revenue, competitive pressure on loan margins and deposit pricing but as we sit here today, I think a lot of the things that we pointed to in the past in terms of balance sheet mix at least have largely run their course.

I do think if you look back historically, cash and securities were roughly 25% of our balance sheet, we're a little bit above that but given our needs for liquidity and how we use the investment portfolio, I would think that something in that 25% range of the size of the balance sheet is a reasonable assumption for that, then on the loan side, it really becomes a matter of just marketplace dynamics what we see as opportunities for growth and so whether card is growing more quickly than say auto or commercial, it's percentage of the rest of the balance sheet could drift up but I don't want to give any indication of how we think that's playing out and, there's certainly not a target that we have in terms of the P&L, the asset side of the balance sheet.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Andrew Young\", \"section_number\": 19, \"uuid\": \"0bb7dd0e-bdfa-4f6b-bdb9-3b5e77749566\", \"speaker_title\": \"Chief Financial Officer at Capital One Financial\"}"}, {"id": 36, "text": "On the funding side, we aim to have a diversified mix of funding that's largely skewed to retail deposits which again historically has been something I think around 70% of our overall funding and we have commercial deposits and brokered CDs and then securitization and wholesale funding--other sources of wholesale funding and so again. I would say if you look back to pre-pandemic levels over history compared to where we are today. We're kind of back in a relatively similar place there. So. I think I heard in your question not just mix but how do we fund growth from here. In making marginal decisions for funding incremental loan growth we're going to weigh a variety of factors, customers' appetite for different deposit products and our ability to build customer relationships with them, the economics of different funding instruments, the duration of funding our liquidity needs, so we're going to throw all of that into our decision making process to figure out how to fund but I also think it's important to think about those funding choices at the margin. It's not just about the liability side, we also have asset growth choices at the margin too, so we're just going to look at the total integrated economics of both sides of the balance sheet to make those choices.

A year and a half ago we had a CET1 in the high 14, since then we've been repurchasing shares and our CET1 ratio has come down into the low 12s. And the pace of our repurchases is of course driven by a number of factors including our actual and forecasted capital, earnings of course growth, economic conditions, market dynamics and at this point there remains some pretty sizable error bars around some of these factors particularly growth and economic uncertainty and so it's not lost on us at times like this.

So, let's talk about competition in the card business and, then I'll talk about it in the auto business but generally in the card business, competition continues to be high but largely stable and rational over the past few quarters. Now here, I'm really talking about the major--the banking industry the classic competitive set within the card business but we certainly have seen marketing levels that have returned to really beyond pre-pandemic levels, so we certainly have an eye on that. On the rewards competition side there's--here there are new things that people come out with but there is generally a stability in that space on APRs in the card business have generally--the issuers have generally adjusted headline rates along with the change in the prime rate, so there is kind of a stability in the margins there. So, again we see a pretty stable competitive environment in the major--among major card players. A thing that we've mentioned a number of times is concern about the fintechs and their impact on a business like the card business, less so by the fintechs actually running around, issuing credit cards but more by the impact from other credit products like instalment loans, buy now pay later loans and others that can affect the portfolio of borrowing that our customers--current and prospective customers might have. So we were pretty concerned and we've talked about it a number of times about the rapidly growing extent of FinTech credit extension compounded by the fact no one can measure the size of it because many of these folks like many of the buy now pay later players for example not reporting to the credit bureaus. The other thing that caught our eye, of course, all along the way here is, virtually every FinTech that enters lending enters in the lower side of the market. There is virtually no one that enters right at the heavy spenders side of the market, they just don't have the scale for those thin margin businesses and so the FinTech accesses to the extent that they're there were logically and inferentially from what would be more in the lower end of the market and, that of course is something we watch pretty carefully to the best extent that we can see it. Now, one thing that just intuitively is a helpful thing to the cause here is that FinTechs have generally struggled, they seem to have dialed back quite a bit so there may be less pressure in that particular space but, another thing to keep our eye out for here is it's not just the amount of volume of marketing or the intensity of competition, it's the underwriting choices that folks make.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Rich Fairbank\", \"section_number\": 26, \"uuid\": \"97213861-9a2f-42dd-8f7a-3b303ce9b5fc\", \"speaker_title\": \"Chief Executive Officer at Capital One Financial\"}"}, {"id": 49, "text": "Another thing, Sanjay, that we have had our eye on is basically FICO drift and you can absolutely see out there the reduction in the size of the sub-prime population.

So we ourselves do our best to try to normalize for those effects in our underwriting. And, so, [Technical Issues] to say, I think the competitive risks that exist and that we have seen out there are more in the lower end of the marketplace. Even with credit cards themselves if you look at the data there has been the highest.--there's been more growth in the lower-end of the market in terms of just credit card customers than anywhere else. So, all of this is something we're watching incredibly carefully and to the earlier question that was asked about how do we do underwriting we, of course, do everything we can to look at every segment to look for any changes that we're seeing ultimately in our own performance. We've trimmed around the edges in a few places but overall so far it looks pretty good but partly how we do this we don't just run around and just let the numbers do the talking. We do a combination of using actually machine-learning monitoring base methodologies to look for early signs of things being off of expectation within our portfolio.

Let me just comment a little bit on--just a little bit of a calibration of how we think about credit in the card and auto businesses. The first point would be it's normalizing in both places, but overall credit has been strong in both our card and our auto business. But there are three effects that are driving faster normalization of auto losses than of card losses. And the first is that normalization tends to be more pronounced in the front book of new originations, that's a universal thing that applies across our consumer businesses. But because the front book--in auto the front book replaces the portfolio much more quickly than in card, Overall portfolio losses should normalize more quickly in the auto business. The second is that recovery rates are much higher in auto than in card. Recoveries tend to be lag relative to charge-offs. So some of the exceptionally strong performance we saw in auto including the quarter where we actually had negative charge-offs, that was boosted by higher recoveries from earlier charge-offs. Now that we've seen low charge-offs for an extended period in auto, the raw material for future recoveries is coming down even if the recovery rate stay strong. And this will have a bigger impact in auto than in card but it will be an effect in both businesses and it's not something that I think gets a lot of airtime out there but recoveries are definitionally about what's happening with a -- if you will the back book of recoveries and in both of our businesses the back book which has been the byproduct of the great news in the last few years in terms of credit, the back-book there's just less to work with but it's especially in effect in auto and finally, auto vehicle values are now normalizing which is a headwind relative to a year ago and contributes to the pace of credit normalization in that business and given where used car prices have been going to sort of record levels over the past year, the general direction of that is much more likely to be down rather than up so that also contributes to a difference between those two businesses.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Rich Fairbank\", \"section_number\": 31, \"uuid\": \"1ba55a20-a6d4-4eab-9825-dcd8a352b839\", \"speaker_title\": \"Chief Executive Officer at Capital One Financial\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Moshe Orenbuch", "id": 59, "section": [{"id": 60, "text": "Thanks.

I've often said it can look good on paper to have rising rates but I for three decades have been rooting against rises in rates because of the sort of unquantifiable other aspects on the business, now of course no one out here is rooting for the kind of inflation that we're seeing and the kind of risk there but I just want to flag that, while the math talks about certain benefits that come, just a couple, kind of obvious, but I think important things that affect many of our metrics in the business. One is the conversation that we just had about the auto business. I think most businesses in the world--most industries struggle when the cost of goods sold goes up struggled to get that to make its way into pricing and the auto business is a classic example of this and, particularly since, unlike if you're selling groceries at the store, it's pretty clear what's the cost of goods sold and therefore how you might want to price those groceries. In this business with the complexity that comes from how any particular auto lender calculates their funds transfer pricing and really effectively what is their margin that can put pressures in the business and what we're seeing in auto the compression in margins, the growth opportunity that we're losing right now, that can sort of swamp the massive Andrew's interest-rate calculations and then of course, I think the biggest issue is the impact of rising rates on the economy and on potentially credit outcomes and back to our friend the operating efficiency ratio. Credit impacts make their way into the operating efficiency ratio, of course through--well through the growth--through how much growth we can get and also things like the fee and finance charge reserve impacts. That come, so, that's why I think in many ways the kind of progress that we continue to hope to achieve over the years and operating efficiency ratio might be more in spite of rather than because of higher rates.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Rich Fairbank\", \"section_number\": 34, \"uuid\": \"ed2a9875-f7a5-4eab-a7d0-0573c8eb4527\", \"speaker_title\": \"Chief Executive Officer at Capital One Financial\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Jeff Norris", "id": 65, "section": [{"id": 66, "text": "Next question, please.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Jeff Norris\", \"section_number\": 35, \"uuid\": \"382c4577-7deb-4366-a5cb-22611ed11c7b\", \"speaker_title\": \"Senior Vice President-Finance at Capital One Financial\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Arren Cyganovich", "id": 67, "section": [{"id": 68, "text": "Thanks.

But I think that the bigger point there is that we continue to see more traction there and whenever you see metrics about growth in purchase volume, we don't share metrics about what kind of growth rate we're getting at each spender level in the marketplace but the higher the spender level, the higher even faster growth rate we've been getting so that's a manifestation of the success we're getting and it's both the byproduct of the investment we're making but also leads us to continue to lean in to those investments. But for all you hear of our enthusiastic comments about the top of the market, I don't want to leave an impression that we are therefore less enthusiastic about the opportunity elsewhere. We continue to grow across the credit spectrum. We have several decades of experience in the lower end of the market and one of the real benefits of our tech transformation has been allowing us to build a lot more sophistication, more data, more machine learning and other things into the credit underwriting process and that allows us to be stronger and have more growth opportunities and better credit quality in the--at the lower end of the market. So, the story--the net impression I want to leave with you is one of very continued success across the spectrum. There are places however that we for a long period of time have been cautious about and frankly doing our best to minimize and one of those is high balance revolvers. So, high balance revolvers--what that term to us, just to clarify that concept is, not necessarily what are the balances that any revolver, any customer might have with us but it's collectively there total Bureau balances and we have been very cautious about booking customers for years now and even more so after the Great Recession, booking customers with a high-level of balance--revolver balances across their--that consumer's portfolio. It tends to be great to not go there, ties one hand behind our back a little bit in terms of growth because growing high balance revolvers is a good way to grow and it also tends to be quite profitable business but that is a segment that we have been concerned about the resilience and downturns and so we've tended to for years now try to de-emphasize that. I say de-emphasize as no one can fully get out of a segment like that because we can't control whether our own customers turn into high balance revolvers but what we can control is whether they enter as high balance revolvers.

The second is really aligned to what you were just talking about but it's kind of a combination of factors and that is really our outlook for future losses, net of recoveries against that balance sheet, so that starts from a place of looking at what is in the delinquency buckets today which gives us a really good view of how the next, say six months or so of losses are going to play out. And then after that period we have an assumption of continued normalization from those unusually strong levels and then beyond that horizon as I think under CECL there's just an assumption of a gradual revision to historical averages. And then the third point is we apply qualitative factors against all of those expectations to account for uncertainties around economic downsides and inflation related risks and so, when we think about the allowance going-forward, yes. I mean today's allowance of course does incorporate in what is in the delinquency buckets today and what that implies. But as we go forward, the allowance is really going to primarily be determined by just the growth in the balance sheet and we saw that impact the allowance this quarter but then secondly every quarter we continue to normalize we are going to be replacing lower loss content of the current quarter with higher loss content of future quarters which again will be informed by how the delinquencies playing through each successive quarter.

So, as I've said in absolutely normal times this thing should normalize, so the way--we look at that and say and expect that should continue and then we look at the economy and the way that we would always look at that as we've done many times we've been looking down the gun barrel of potentially highly uncertain and maybe likely a worse economy. And it's certainly hard to be in the prediction business. But what we do is., there is couple of big things that we do as an approach. First of all we underwrite to an assumption of worsening, we try to make it so if things go bad it's not a surprise. It would be really bad banking to--it would be underwriting to good scenarios and I know everyone tries to be conservative but I'm just saying with over three decades in building this company, at the heart of it is underwriting that looks in the rear-view mirror of how programs are doing and overlaying a worsening assumption on that because that is--could happen and we need to be resilient to that. You'll often hear Capital One talking about the word resilient. Without a crystal ball about what's going to happen over time the critical thing is, what is the resilience of the loans that we're booking and we spend a lot of time for example in the card business just looking at the ratio of revenue margin to the charge-off rates and stressing that and all kinds of things. So we underwrite to worsening that's a very important thing. Secondly it is the management of credit decisions at the micro level so that we're looking for the earliest indications of where problems can occur and like, I said earlier, that's both--let me just give you a little bit of window into that.

But the tech investment pulling way up has tremendously enhanced Capital One's overall flexibility, our ability to turn quickly in the marketplace to make credit choices.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Rich Fairbank\", \"section_number\": 62, \"uuid\": \"a5718248-15c8-4852-8e64-3d9a7472b694\", \"speaker_title\": \"Chief Executive Officer at Capital One Financial\"}"}, {"id": 113, "text": "If you look back when we all went--when the world went into a vertical freefall of uncertainty in the pandemic, just look back at how quickly Capital One turned with respect to some of the pullbacks we did that would not have been possible in the more legacy world that we lived in before, so the ability to respond quickly, the ability to create changes in the offerings to consumers, the ability to create flexibility in offerings, flexibility in forbearance, new ways to adapt to the marketplace. Everything about Capital One, the speed of change, of managed change is dramatically different from before. We also, and this is probably the most important recession resilience point, is the monitoring point I made earlier to have put in place a much more comprehensive real-time monitoring capability with root cause analysis that's much more comprehensive than what we could have done before. Will allow us to be informed earlier on about things that are happening and I do want to say I've been asked by a number of investors. Rich, we know you well enough to know how cautious you are about the economy and about downturns and the utmost respect for what--how risk can play-out in these businesses. Why are you leaning into the marketing opportunity and one of the reasons that we're doing that is this substantially improved measurement, monitoring and speed of response and the level of segmentation and micro segmentation by which we can do that.

I can only sort of speculate here but the most striking thing about the global financial crisis and Great Recession that from payment hierarchy point of view is what we saw with people literally walking away from their mortgages and what was really high on the payment hierarchy was auto loans and that may be a more universal resilience point on the auto side because people still have to drive to work. So that's probably more of a have a sustaining inside. I think that. The. We got to look at student loans and think about where. I think we've already observed that's pretty low in the payment hierarchy and trends these days and for forgiveness in various things there would probably ensure that's on the lower end. Another one that I would probably just speculate would add to the hierarchy this year is this time around is fintechs and I think the fintechs who don't report to the credit bureaus, may have enjoyed their stealth opportunity to grow. But that's probably not lost on the consumers and so I think, one of the reasons we've really leaned harder into having spending be the anchor part of a consumer credit card relationship is that it's not only a healthier place to be from the consumer point of view but I think counting on that credit card and making sure that you've got that in a downturn, that helps from a payment hierarchy point of view.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Rich Fairbank\", \"section_number\": 66, \"uuid\": \"2b737b37-477a-473e-aa17-00708e1ee48e\", \"speaker_title\": \"Chief Executive Officer at Capital One Financial\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Dominick Gabriele", "id": 120, "section": [{"id": 121, "text": "Okay great and then just, now when you just think, I just want to go back to the tech investment and spend and how you think about it over the cycle and perhaps even some of the peers that you talk to at conferences.

This is a great question. In case you haven't noticed, I have a pretty deep conviction about the benefit of these tech investments and that's not just how I feel that's how all of us collectively feel here at Capital One. And the benefits of that tech investment are so comprehensive although with company weak, inside this company we can see them everywhere and they were so enhanced how we work the ability to manage risk, the ability to serve customers, the ability to create new products, the ability to grow. And because we see such benefits, we are continuing to lean into tech investments and as I mentioned earlier there is sort of under the surface quite a bit of productivity gain coming from the tech investment but on the other hand at the same time we're leaning in pretty hard into tech investments such that the effects are not that dramatic. In fact over close to a decade there has been a more gradual kind of improvement in operating efficiency. There is always the opportunity if times get really tough to pull-back on tech investments but we are not viewing these like luxury investments and just, what to do on a rainy--on a sunny day because they are very materially transforming the opportunities of this company and the ability to manage risk and the ability to weather the very downturn that might motivate that reduction in investment.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Rich Fairbank\", \"section_number\": 68, \"uuid\": \"b1eeadfd-56be-434a-a76d-b3379616bd0b\", \"speaker_title\": \"Chief Executive Officer at Capital One Financial\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Jeff Norris", "id": 124, "section": [{"id": 125, "text": "Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on the conference call.
