And buildings in that location, certainly lab buildings in that location have been trading in the -- maybe even in the low 4s. So I think there's significant margin in that yield versus where we made the investment. And then, as it relates to 200 5th, a couple of things I would mention. One, I think it's a very unique property. It is clearly a premier workplace I think transactions like that don't come around very often. Second, I think the cap rate is understated because it has below-market debt on the property for the next 6 years. And then third, we're purchasing a minority interest of stake.

Going to your comparison of 200 5th to 1,330 Avenue of the Americas, humbly, I would say, I think 200 is a higher-quality asset and warrants a lower cap rate. I do think the below-market debt does have some impact on how to think about pricing for the asset because that's clearly an asset to have such a below-market debt on the building. And to your point, with debt cost rising, I absolutely believe that there is some increase in cap rates.

If interest rates start to moderate and the 10-year comes down a little bit or slows its increase and credit spreads which right now are as wide as they've been in a really long time, start to moderate because people kind of see the end of the rate hikes and see what the pain is going to be felt in the economy, we could see credit spreads come in 50, 100, 125 basis points which could help.
