Second is getting it right, meaning that managing expenses has to be done, while continuing to make all the necessary investments in our infrastructure to keep up with an evolving cyber threat environment.

And the other thing we do -- I mean obviously this is a quarterly focus, we report every quarter but we also at the same time, have to keep our eye on the long-term. So we ask ourselves questions like, look when this -- I've called it a bump in the road everything that we're going through right now, COVID and all the other challenges and it's certainly a longer bump than anybody would like, but we ask ourselves questions like years from now, when we look-back at getting through this, what will we wish we had done in order to improve the long-term health and fundamentals of our business and I think that helps guide us through these things as well.

First of all, in general we did indicate at the last quarterly report that we provided that we saw some indication of trends towards normalization and we did see some of that, we see it again I think it's a bit difficult to be precise in uncertain times, but I think that was a broad statement about general domain names. China is a bit different. China is always sort of a unique situation; domains there and domain investors have their own particular qualities about how they buy domains and how they use them. China has regulations of course and China have some challenges from COVID. We saw names that surged early-on in China having lower first time renewal rates that certainly contributed to some of the data that you saw, but we also saw that many of the pre pandemic names provided renewal rates that are very similar to the long-term renewal rates. So much of what we got in a broader sense were high-quality names.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"D.

So first of all, let me just say I think the submission was a little bit different in the sense that the many other submissions that we made were actually to and IRP panel and this was a submission to ICANN who is now acting on the panel directing them to pursue this through their processes. In fact, early in March the ICANN Board adopted a resolution that instructed one of their Board accounting accountability mechanism committees to evaluate the claims relating to two parties here and those submissions were made directly to ICANN, so that's actually different than what we're doing over the past few years in litigation. I just wanted to offer that clarification. So what the conclusion of the IRP did was basically put this back in ICANN's [Indecipherable] ICANN's process, we've made our submissions. They have our submissions and so, it's an ICANN process and we're just waiting to hear what we'll have from them when they conclude it.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"D.
