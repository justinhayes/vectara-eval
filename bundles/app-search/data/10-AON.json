The only thing we highlighted that was a little different was obviously, the M&A transaction levels last year were extraordinary, and our capability there is just exceptional.

So while inflation and while pricing may be moving against them from this perspective, they don't sit still. They're looking at whether it's captive utilization, whether it's retentions, deductibles, limits, all those tools, and we try and help them think through what's best for them as they're navigating their sort of economic changes that they're facing in their business.

And I think as we move away from Hurricane Ian, we start to get a little more clarity around what the ultimate losses look like and who's holding those losses. But if you step back and you think about it geographically, the European clients, I think, are expecting to have the supply of property cat that they need, albeit with a pricing and structure negotiation -- that takes into account the effects of inflation that's happening in Europe but also the losses that have happened in that region over the last three years, whether it's German floods, French hail, etc.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 2, \"speaker\": \"Eric Andersen\", \"section_number\": 6, \"uuid\": \"079277b4-776f-4b8f-a6c2-f4d303d56c88\", \"speaker_title\": \"President at AON\"}"}, {"id": 14, "text": "They've got certain dynamics that have affected the European marketplace.

I would also say, it also has an effect on facultative reinsurance and other tools that we have because as those insurers are forced to take higher retention, they certainly are going to continue to look to derisk. They just do it with different tools, right? They actually then will look at specific clients that they've got on their primary portfolio that they want help on, they'll use facultative instead of treaty.

The casualty basis on the reinsurance, which people don't tend to talk about but is a substantial part of the industry. They're continuing to battle their own inflation understanding as they price long-tail products. I do think that market is much -- while it's challenged, it is more around price and structure, not about supply. So listen, I think as property cat in the U.S. continues to be challenged for a couple of reasons. One, you've got significant losses, both on the traditional things like hurricane, but also as you think about wildfire, storms, the secondary perils have been a substantial hit to reinsurers over the last five years. So there is a -- certainly a crisis of confidence in underwriting and how they deploy their capital for our clients. And so models have to be better. We really have to focus hard on making sure risk identification, they understand exactly what they're offering and what the sort of return scenarios are for them over time. The effects of interest rates really affect the ILS market, which has two -- I would say, two headwinds right now. One is there's some trapped capital with Ian, as people are trying to figure out exactly what -- where the losses are, what the damage is. And there's also the relative investment question. As interest rates go up, their ability to find other assets that don't risk their capital is something that essentially just creates a repricing, I think, of the ILS market, which is happening. And so for us, I think it doesn't necessarily create work. It creates understanding of the market dynamics and the returns. But we're in the middle of that right now as we lead up to the big 1/1 renewal season.

The real challenge, Meyer is the economics haven't made it make sense to actually be able to buy out because we haven't been able to execute the transfers without being able to add the cash given to get to fully funded. And so the increase in interest rates is getting planned to fully funded, which means that they can actually do this transfer. So the capacity has always been there. It's more that the pension plans haven't been funded enough to be able to make this work. And I would say, we're seeing more demand from this for buy-ins and buyouts from clients than we have in the last 10-plus years, and we have done substantial numbers of pension risk transfer in the U.S. and the U.K. and are very, very well positioned to do it.

And just there's one -- something that happened a week or two ago that just came to mind as you were talking, Christa. We do these Insight series across the world with our clients. And normally, historically, would have flown everybody in from around the world, and this one happened to be in Australia. So it would have been a week of time for the team of -- basically off the grid as they went to present an hour slot for whatever topic they were asking for.

We were able to deliver the capability, and we gained the hours that we would have lost to the flights and the jet lag and everything else that we all know about in a way that drives more productivity. So that's just one example. There's many of them that follow the similar path. We just did a big renewal meeting, for example, for a big U.S. client, where we used the immersion room in our New York office and brought in the European insurers and reinsurers and the London European insurers and reinsurers and essentially did what would have been a three week trip, turned it into a five hour session in one location. And so again, saves time, saves money, but more importantly, the clients are finding value in it. They actually feel like they're getting that connection with the markets that they want. And our colleagues, it actually allows us to sell off our global colleagues in a way that you don't really get to do when you're traveling place to place and so focused on schedule.
