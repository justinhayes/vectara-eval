So in 2023, we will continue spending on Payara and Yellowtail, but we will add, subject to government approval, a third development project at Uaru, and to a lesser amount, a gas to energy project as well. So while the Uaru project is going to have industry leading returns in a low cost-to-supply, the cost of the Uaru project, as you mentioned, will be higher, reflecting the current market conditions as well as additional scope to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Fair enough. And I just wanted to turn to the Bakken for a minute and Just wondering if you had any updated thoughts on our experience with recompletions up there? If I recall, you had done some work going back to some of the older vintage wells were done sort of at the the original much lighter completions out there. And so -- and if you have been doing anything out there, what the potential -- I guess about what the returns might look like for sort of work?", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Noel Parks\", \"section_number\": 78, \"uuid\": \"f988263b-dce8-4c57-b50e-e60730f58b97\", \"speaker_title\": \"Analyst at Touhy Brothers\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Gregory P.
