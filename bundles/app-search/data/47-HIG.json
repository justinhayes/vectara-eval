As Doug discussed, we did see some impact from property losses, non-CAT, non-weather related that obviously impacted that compare year-over-year, but when we look at year-to-date where we are compared to what we thought at the beginning of the year, we are right in line. As it relates specifically to the workers' compensation point, again if you go back to what we were expecting from the beginning of the year, we're very much right in line. We did not make any changes in the quarter as it relates to workers' comp and our loss picks from where we've been from the beginning of this year and we had said at the beginning of this year that in this line, we expected a small amount of compression in workers' comp and that's exactly what we've been booking to. And I say small, less than 0.5 point, part of that compared to last third quarter and why that was called out was in the last year's third quarter, we had some true-ups in the quarter related to just some favorable frequency and rate coming in a bit higher than we had anticipated.
