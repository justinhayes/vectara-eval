And then on the pilot shortage issue, in general, are you in favor of any increase in the pilot retirement age or changes to training from the 1,500-hour rule? I know Republicans had some trouble with that. How do you think about that? And do you think there's a need for any legislative or regulatory changes there?", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Leslie Josephs\", \"section_number\": 106, \"uuid\": \"da090e79-79c3-46c3-a267-39879d5357ed\", \"speaker_title\": \"Analyst at CNBC\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Robert E.

And I'm not going to talk about negotiations here, obviously. We're in mediation with both our pilots and our flight attendants. And I'm hopeful that helps, and it helps move us to a deal sooner because again, I want to get contracts, and we'd love to get them soon with our awesome employees. But we are -- as you look at both inflation and then as you look at deals that are occurring in the industry, we had Alaska just had a pilot deal last week, for example. As Tammy mentioned, we look at those and then we manage our accruals accordingly. And I would say, you never know until you get there. But I would say, right now, it feels like we're adequately accrued for all our groups beginning last April, of course, but I think our approvals look really reasonable to me. Now the markets really move. Who knows? But in terms of what we've seen happen so far, our accruals are very reasonable.
