So, on the earn-in for 2023, I think -- if it's okay with you, I wanted to step back and make sure we're using a consistent definition. For us, the way we look at earn-in is we look to the September loss-to-lease, it's not too hot and not too cold, and take 50% of that. So, in this case, September loss-to-lease was close to 7%, taking half of it would be about 3.5%, and that will be our earning, and we assume no market rent growth. Now, what we've heard is there's a question about 2023 revenue growth and how does the earn-in applied to that. And so what we've done in the past is explain that by saying, you take your earn-in and then we look at our 2023 S17 market rent growth and take 50% of that.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Angela L.

You add that to the 3.5% earn-in, that gives you a proxy of about 4.5% for revenue growth for 2023. And so, as far as the loss-to-lease, where we are is we're about 2.5% loss-to-lease in October for the portfolio. And of course, it varies by region, but that's coming from a loss-to-lease in September of 6.7%, so definitely a deceleration. But it is expected and loss-to-lease at this level for October is actually better than our historical patterns. Typically, around this time of the year, we're at about 1% loss-to-lease and heading towards zero by year-end.

And so, it's -- it's lumpy and all that other stuff. And so, we are just commenting on the historical patterns. So, by the end of the year, probably loss-to-lease is zero or negative gain-to-lease. And then January hits and we start getting all the new budgets, all the new hiring, etc., that occurs in that first quarter, and that makes the markets recover. So, that's how it works.

And there's just a huge housing shortage. It's the backdrop behind all of this. And so, we think that we can get some rent growth. Obviously, moving into for-sale housing is people are locked into the rental renter pool in the B space. And as a result of that, we think we can get a little bit.
