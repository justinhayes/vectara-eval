And we talk a lot about Aviation. Obviously, you guys asked, but the commercial helicopter business is also seeing very robust demand, and those guys are performing well. And it's obviously offsetting the historical military programs, which continue to ramp down a little bit. But look, I think on the FLRAA, George, it's -- obviously, it was in our original guide. That's why we're certainly seeing lower absorption. We expect it to be kind of under contract at this stage of the game, but it's something we're managing our way through.

As you know, the corporate -- they're used to sort of looking out in that 18-month, two-year or so time frame, as they plan their fleet refreshes. So, the lead times that are there right now aren't something that they're not accustomed to and that kind of fits in their plan. So, we are seeing that activity. We are still seeing some new activity. And again, we continue to see a lot of -- there are certainly new people who are coming in more than normal that are buying a whole aircraft. But we also see just the demand of new people coming into the market that are using either a fractional or charter operations. And so, we continue to see strong demand from those customers as well.

And we're also very strong on the electric side in terms of our vehicle businesses, right? I mean we've pioneered over the years a lot of that electrification.

We're obviously very interested in the outcome of FLRAA, but Bell is hardly a one-trick pony, right? I mean there's a lot of other stuff going on. I think when you think about the maritime strike and overall, there's active AoA activity going on right now in the in the Department of the Navy thinking about what they do with their future of aircraft replacement programs. Obviously, we think that our offering, which is that tiltrotor space is very attractive to them. I mean, these are services that obviously today operate V-22s and they need aircraft and assets that can keep up with V-22. So, it's -- I think we feel like the tiltrotor solution is a good answer in that space. These programs are relatively early on. They say they're doing their analysis for alternatives and that will lead to more acquisition activity here in the next couple two, three years. So, we're very close to those programs, obviously. The Air Force, as has been fairly public, is talking about what they want to do for frankly higher speed VTOL, right? So, even beyond the kinds of speeds that we see today in a V-22 or in V-280 class of aircraft, we're highly engaged with the Air Force on those sorts of programs. So, I think there's no doubt that what we're seeing with the Army, and obviously, that's a huge opportunity to replace that sort of the Blackhawk class of aircraft that you will see similar programs in the Navy, Marine Corps and in the Air Force in one form or fashion, and our guys are highly engaged in those program opportunities.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Scott C.

So, we have a couple that are in the works right now that we haven't yet announced, but obviously the work is going on.
