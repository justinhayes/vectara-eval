We're getting access to more people who can use our technology and use our better product. For right now, we haven't seen any macro trends that would make us feel that this isn't going to continue.

In terms of commercial payers following, we do expect to see that as you certainly think of Medicare Advantage plans. But even as you have folks really progressing throughout their journey, we know that this product ultimately reduces cost from the system, improves lives and outcomes. And so we do expect those to come along as well. In terms of reimbursement, the way that CMS typically reverses it is based on qualification and this is an expansion of the category of qualification. And so thus far, it looks like it's reimbursed in line with the existing qualifications. And at the end of the day, it's incumbent upon us and we think we continue to show it that the economic benefits of putting somebody on CGM far outweigh the costs. And so it's on us to continue to show that evidence and we think we can continue to prove that as more and more evidence comes.

And are the pieces in place for that just to continue to expand meaningfully in the coming couple of - 2 years?", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Steven Lichtman\", \"section_number\": 40, \"uuid\": \"149e27dd-24a0-450f-8965-fc8dabb693a8\", \"speaker_title\": \"Analyst at Oppenheimer\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Jereme Sylvain", "id": 59, "section": [{"id": 60, "text": "Thanks for the question. We continue to do very, very well. So if you think about kind of where that type 2 intensive penetration is, it's surpassing 35%. In terms of how we're doing, I think couple of maybe data points which I think is helpful. First off, record new patients, Q2. Q3 is in line with that based on early feedback, could even be a little bit higher. And so you're seeing patients coming in which is just an indication of more and more folks adopting where a good majority of those are coming from that type 2 intensive population. It's our fastest-growing segment. I think you also think about it from a context of who we call on. And as we look at our sales team, we talk about productivity, more than third-quarters of the calls we make are now to primary care physicians. And that's because that's where we're looking to expand over time. So I think what we've done in expanding the salesforce last year and really focusing on those sales tools, thinking about the type 2 intensive and then beyond, basal and beyond, I think you're really seeing that play out. And you're seeing some very strong growth in that type 2 intensive segment and it sets us up well for that basal segment.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Jereme Sylvain\", \"section_number\": 41, \"uuid\": \"ca76ea68-a01a-4b01-83d1-b96596a9b555\", \"speaker_title\": \"Chief Financial Officer at DexCom\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Matt Miksic", "id": 61, "section": [{"id": 62, "text": "Hi. Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up on some of the questions about how the ramp-up of G7, it is a little bit of a modeling question, not really at all sort of a guidance question. But just in terms of how the portfolio comes together and works maybe following up on Kyle's question on ramping up these new lines. Can you talk a little bit about channel, how the sort of middle of the P&L might respond or flex as you kind of get into some of the opportunities you're talking about? Is there a channel synergy across all of these? Do you expect to have to kind of spend into some of these opportunities and then get leverage over time? Maybe if you could talk a little bit about that, that would be super helpful. Thank you.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Matt Miksic\", \"section_number\": 43, \"uuid\": \"21b41b4f-3912-41d6-b809-a912aa8fc63e\", \"speaker_title\": \"Analyst at Barclays\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Jereme Sylvain", "id": 63, "section": [{"id": 64, "text": "Yes, sure. So the line - the way you think about the lines and this is the way we've set it up is DexCom ONE physical form factor cost to manufacture, not necessarily cost to support and how we service it but really the physical product. DexCom ONE is very similar to G6. There are other features that G6 has but hardware is very similar. And it's very similar in G7. G7 lines and eventually DexCom ONE will migrate to a G7 line. And so as you think about these products, then it becomes a question of price point and then how we ultimately service the patient there. So that's the way to think about it. Over time, as we go into certain markets depending on price point, it's got much less to do with what I would say is the physical product itself. We grow into those markets over time through economies of scale. And so that's one of the reasons we believe with DexCom ONE, there's a real great opportunity here. The economies of scale for us are massive. And by going into those markets, we certainly can grow into that profitability profile. So as you think down the middle of the P& L, certainly, as you go into DexCom ONE, there could be a slight margin differentiation but those economies of scales help offset it. We also look at the service model and we're able to manage the service model in a different way. So the ultimate operating margin contribution is the same. So that's how we think about it. And so as you're modeling it through, that's how I would think about it.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Jereme Sylvain\", \"section_number\": 44, \"uuid\": \"a5e5a3dc-626e-4574-8923-64843c7fdcab\", \"speaker_title\": \"Chief Financial Officer at DexCom\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Kevin Sayer", "id": 65, "section": [{"id": 66, "text": "Yes. I'd just add to that. And I don't want this lost on the call. Take a look at our operating performance this quarter. Record cash flows as a former CFO is something I love to hear. And so we have managed our business very tightly. As we look at these, we're works new product lines, your question is very appropriate. And we do have work streams about our cost to serve our patients, our cost to develop our new products, our manufacturing costs given all these new things we're doing. We are looking at the cost structure of the company every bit as much as we're looking at the product launches.

Good evening. Thanks for question. I wanted to just ask about the sequential acceleration in 3Q of revenue growth. And either if you could quantify or just qualitatively describe the contributions from your new pump partner. And just on that topic, if you can just remind us the requirements once G7 is approved to integrate G7 into the Tandem insulin pumps. Any steps that you can highlight and what your expectations are on that front? And can anything be done in front of G7 approval with year-over-year partners?

And let me turn it over to Jake, who is our maestro on product development and understanding products. In terms of contribution, look, we're very excited about both Tandem and Insulet products. And as they launch more and more products that we are obviously integrated with, we expect it to contribute. Now quantifying that and having those contributions, it's a little bit difficult to do given some products - some folks were already on DexCom CGM who bring in a pump and some folks pull over. So as time moves on, we'll be able to really tease that apart. But I think what we would say is we're still bullish on the opportunity of folks ultimately using our product with these incredible pump partners. I'll leave it at that just because it gets hard to contribute. Again, we'll be able to retrospectively give feedback as time moves on. But let me give it to Jake in terms of the connectivity and the timelines on G7.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Jereme Sylvain\", \"section_number\": 48, \"uuid\": \"8c4d7d14-6f85-4830-a28c-ae376949d002\", \"speaker_title\": \"Chief Financial Officer at DexCom\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Jake Leach", "id": 71, "section": [{"id": 72, "text": "Yes. Thanks, Jereme. So on G7 integration with our pump partners, basically, the steps are to make a few updates on the pump side to take advantage of the new features that are within G7 such as the fast warm up as well as the grace period. And so those groups are already - they have been already working on that for quite a while. And so we do see great progress on those integrations. They've gone through kind of final steps of development and validation. So a lot of that work can be, to your point, done ahead of time. And so when it comes to a specific timing of approvals and launches, we'll leave that to our pump partners. But we're progressing very rapidly and we do expect them to be integrated soon. One thing I'll note is that on our other side on the digital health partners, for example, in Europe where we have G7 out, those that are connected up to our real-time API already have G7 integrations. For example, Sugarmate is a group that's already consuming G7 data within their app at the beginning of the launch.

Our teams are just executing very well as we press towards the end of the year and look to build momentum next year. I want to thank our team members for their hard work to strive towards these goals. It is all hands on deck to get G7 done, to get DexCom ONE out in these markets and do all the things that we are trying to do. But I want to close with a special note. I want to thank all the members of the diabetes community that have been working together to help improve access to CGM technology. The recent CMS proposal represents a big win for people with diabetes. And we're only one member of a large group advocating for this result. This was a collective effort from the diabetes community on behalf of the diabetes community.
