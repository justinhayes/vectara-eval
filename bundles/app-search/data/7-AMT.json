So that have to happen first. And if that does happen, then we could convert $200 million of our existing accounts receivable into a convertible note. The reason that's interesting to us, number one, is it helps shore up Voda a little bit. It basically moves the account receivable and, let's say, an MLA default into more of a financial interest and it helps them get some equity and maybe some additional debt on their book. So we want to support them and help them through this difficult time. So that certainly is one reason. The other thing having this note, it does have predefined payment time frame in it, which is a little bit more certain than what you might see in typical accounts receivable that's hanging on the balance. And then we also have the option at our option to convert it to equity, which is another way for us to liquidate that favorable balance. So I think it increases our flexibility. It increases the probability in the near term to convert it to cash, and that's really the reason we're interested in doing it. So -- and it helps Voda.

And Michael, I'll just add, in terms of the churn, the near term, one thing that you will see is our churn rates are actually coming down from Q3 to Q4. So globally, we -- in our 2.6% Q3 organic tenant billings growth, there was about 5.5% -- 5.4% that was cancellations or churn. That's going to step down to about 4% in Q4, which will end up driving our organic tenant billings growth for Q4, up from that mid-2s up to over -- well over 4%, certainly, which is really good. And that 4.4% in Q4 is what helps us drive that 3% for the full year. And in the U.S., you're seeing that churn drop in the U.S. So the good news here is we're through the big bulk -- the initial bulk of Sprint churn. You're going to see organic tenant billings growth for Q4 in the U.S. at around 4%, which will be getting us back to where we really want to be longer term. And then in the international markets, we do have some, as Tom was saying some churn events, some elevated churn. Those churn events will be temporary as certain countries go through a little consolidation. But you will see from Q3 to Q4, churn will step up by about 100 basis points, going from about a little under 5% to up into the 5s churn in the international markets. And the only thing I'd call out specifically is in Latin America, you will see -- that's where a bulk of that temporary churn will begin to hit. So you will see a step up in our churn rates in Latin America going from about 5% in Q3, up to a little over 8% in Q4. And that's all the normal churn that we've all talked about that you guys know is coming. Some of that will persist into next year as well, particularly in Latin America.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Rodney M.

Now having said that, when I back up, I also believe that, that capital is going to be spent over time. And that could be a timing issue as well.

We work through plans with the rating agencies to delever our investment-grade credit rating. That is critical to us. That's very important. We take leverage very seriously. That's why we've been able to delever as quickly as we have, going down from that 6.8 to 5.5. I'd also tell you that the 5.5 is -- we're comfortably lower than the delevering plan that we've agreed with the rating agency. So that puts us in a pretty good position.

But it's important to point out that it is a benefit when it comes to our ability to delever. And then, of course, when we think about what we do with that capacity or any other capital capacity that we have available to us, we'll always put a share buyback up against our own internally generated net asset value of the company and what we look at in terms of the share value. We're also balancing the analysis around the cost of debt and how we drive better AFFO per share accretion, either paying down our revolving credit lines or buying back shares. So there's a lot of math as you know, that goes into that. So we expect to be flexible and opportunistic as we evaluate what we do with our capital.

So they will convert to equity. When that happens, then their ownership will jump up from the 28% to 29% up to about 36%. The way to think about the MI impacts here, when you get to Q4 and hit the run rate, you're going to see about $150 million of Q4 exit run rate for the European minority and then you'll see about $60 million or so for the Stonepeak minority interest. That will all run through kind of the minority interest section. On these preferred notes that we have with Stonepeak, you'll see another $45 million that will be interest that will run through the interest line, but you want to keep that in mind as well.
