The first is VX-880, and that one is actually in phase one/two. So it's a program that's already in patients. That's the program in which we've already achieved proof of concept based on the first two patients treated, importantly with half the targeted dose. That program is now continuing. We are enrolling and dosing patients at the full targeted dose and we do expect to share data next year at the appropriate conference or venue.

So it's a little bit too early to comment on exactly when we'll see data, but I would think about the program closer to CTX than to small molecules.

Mohit, thanks for the kind words. Your question is about CFTR modulators in general? And what can we expect in terms of benefit? Let me just blow out that question a little bit more and broaden it. When you think about the benefit of CFTR modulators, it's important to realize that CF, as a disease, is a systemic disease. So the only manifestation is not the lung. It is a very prominent manifestation, but it's not the only manifestation. So what do I mean by that? CF patients also have difficulty with liver disease. They also have difficulty with endocrine and exocrine pancreatic disease, and you know about the difficulty in gaining weight, gaining height and living a high-quality life in the absence of CFTR modulators. So the real benefit of CFTR modulators, and we've seen this with KALYDECO to start with all the way up to TRIKAFTA, is certainly an improvement in lung function.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Reshma Kewalramani\", \"section_number\": 5, \"uuid\": \"c59eefb5-e86f-4d22-b10e-6a496e83e978\", \"speaker_title\": \"Chief Executive Officer and President at Vertex Pharmaceuticals\"}"}, {"id": 10, "text": "And the way we measure that acutely is indeed ppFEV1.

So I think the jury is still out, and we have the next wave of molecules to look forward to. And just to close out the benefits, there are some abstracts coming out at NACFC that include data from TRIKAFTA and some of our other CFTR modulators.

We have a validated target, and we also have a biomarker that translates from bench to bedside. There are about 100,000 people in Europe and the U.S. who have this disease. And by the way, it happens to be a pulmonary disease that is a disease of protein misfolding, something we know a little bit about given our work in cystic fibrosis.

It has better drug-like properties, and it has initiated its Phase I study. And in parallel, we're also advancing VX-864 because we have chronic tox coverage to study this molecule in a longer-term study. And in a longer-term study, we can assess liver clearance of polymer.

I referenced the fact that there's 1.5 billion treatment days a year, and much of that is concentrated in the hospital environment despite the fact that the market is over 90% generic, as you referenced, is a $4 billion market today. So the real question is, what is the unmet need here. And the unmet need is actually very, very significant. In contrast to your comments, actually, the acute use of opioids is a very prominent and well-recognized contributor to the opioid epidemic.

So in the hospital setting, both in terms of the inpatient stay, which is probably on average two, three, four days, something like that, we think there's a substantial unmet medical need.

Is it possible that VX-634 is the molecule we select because it's more potent and has better drug-like properties? Yes, that's possible. And that's why we're running both these programs in parallel. Ultimately, maybe the most important thing to take away is that the small molecule approach to this disease AATD is the only approach that holds the potential to treat both the liver and lung manifestations of this disease.

As you can imagine, a lot of this is about making sure that the right conditions are in place so that patients can get as early as possible access to exa-cel pending, obviously, regulatory approval.

In the EU, about 75% of patients are in four countries, the U.K., France, Italy, and Germany. And so we're looking at the potential to establish treatment centers, about 50 or so here in the U.S., about 25 or so in those four countries in Europe, which we think could serve the vast majority of patients, as I say, pending regulatory approval.

One on CF and one on DMD. Let me take the DMD question first. So to give everyone a little bit of a quick backgrounder. Recall that our approach to DMD is different than most of the approaches out there, which focus on microdystrophin. Our approach is an in vivo gene editing approach that is centered on exon skipping and producing full length, if not near full-length dystrophin. And the reason we believe in this approach is because of the human genetics that we see. So for example, Becker's muscular dystrophy where patients have near full length dystrophin, that disease is a much, much milder form of DMD. The microdystrophin approach simply doesn't have that kind of human genetics behind it. I'm really pleased with the progress of the program.
