The leadership change in seamless and will support the hotel company's current growth strategy. Let me repeat that strategy is based on two core pillars. First catering to group travel at high quality destinations and second developing and operating hotels in immersive destinations. The first, our focus is on hotels with 300 plus keys and ample meeting space that also offer a unique experience to a attract group and transient customers like. We are very encouraged by the recent pickup in group travel at these locations and all our locations with significant meeting space. The properties that Loews Hotels owns and in partnership with Universal Orlando are a great example of the second pillar of the Loews Hotels strategy immersive destinations we have built in demand generators. The Universal Orlando partnership has been highly successful spending more than two decades and currently, including eight hotels with 9,000 rooms. Regarding Alex, he assumed the position of President in September of 2020 and has been instrumental in executing the strategy well I just laid out and it is driving our strong results for Loews Hotels.

Our final question is also for you, would you like to update us on your thoughts about interest rates, inflation and the economy as we head into the final quarter of 2022.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Chris Nugent\", \"section_number\": 4, \"uuid\": \"929efe7f-f7b8-4017-af9c-216f52cc9d7a\", \"speaker_title\": \"Investor and Public Relations at Loews\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Jim Tisch", "id": 11, "section": [{"id": 12, "text": "Sure. Our when I started sharing my observations about inflation and the economy in the first quarter of 2021, it was very obvious at least a mid that the Fed should be tightening monetary policy. At that time the economy was running very hard and interest rates will ridiculously low, 2 months ago year-over-year, CPI was running at over 5% and so far this year, it's running at over 8%. At the end of the first quarter of this year the Fed abandoned the warrant transitory and finally kicked into gear. The Fed started to steadily increase the Fed funds rate and more recently to shrink its balance sheet. In the past seven months, Fed funds have moved from almost 0 to, more than 3% with expectations of another 125 basis point increase in the next two months and the bond market as exemplified by the ten year note has moved smartly higher from 1.5% at the beginning of this year to around 4% now. There's no doubt in my mind that the rate increases we have seen in the past year will translate into a slower economy and likewise a reduction in the inflation rate. Home mortgage rates have moved up from 3% at the beginning of the year to over 7% now. This increase in mortgage rates means that the monthly cost of buying a new home has more than doubled in the past 10 months. As a result of the increase in the cost of home ownership we will begin to see a significant reduction in home prices and the fall in the number of housing starts will continue to accelerate all leading to a weakening GDP.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Jim Tisch\", \"section_number\": 5, \"uuid\": \"1969cbcd-4631-45b5-89e2-57283bb2a318\", \"speaker_title\": \"Chief Executive Officer at Loews\"}"}, {"id": 13, "text": "Likewise, other sectors of the economy will react negatively to higher interest rates as well. So far we haven't seen that reduction in inflation, but as you know inflation tends to respond to increases in interest rates with a lag and my guess is that the end of that lag is almost upon us. So, I would expect to see weaker GDP numbers in the coming quarters along with the slowing of inflation as measured by the CPI. In the meantime a number of commodity prices are declining as a result of tightening by the Fed. Copper prices are down 25%, lumber prices are down almost 60% from their highs in March and oil prices almost 30% from their peak in June. In my mind the easy part of the Fed's tightening process will be complete by the end of the year. At that point the Fed funds rate will be over 4% and the Fed will have clawed back some of their inflation fighting credibility. The big question for everyone is whenever the increases in short rates in 2022 will be in to quell inflation or whether the Fed will feel it has to continue to raise short rates in 2023. I'm not alone in my opinion that the Fed should pause at the beginning of 2003 and see how effective they are tightening has been. There will still be in quantitative tightening mode, which means they will be selling term government securities at a rate of more than a trillion dollars a year. And as I said before the lags in Fed policy are unknown even to the wisest economists. Additionally over tightening by the Fed can cause a financial calamity that makes a recession much worse. So would not be unreasonable for the Fed to say after their December FOMC meeting that they will be pausing rate hikes for three months to assess the effects of the, 400 basis-point increase in short rates. They can warrant that if inflation does not begin to come down in that period tightening will continue. But I expect we will see a slowing of economic indicators and a reduction in the rate of increase in prices.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 2, \"speaker\": \"Jim Tisch\", \"section_number\": 5, \"uuid\": \"1969cbcd-4631-45b5-89e2-57283bb2a318\", \"speaker_title\": \"Chief Executive Officer at Loews\"}"}, {"id": 14, "text": "In terms of my fearless forecast as I said previously our foresee what I call a full employment recession, whereby economic growth will be negative for a few quarters, but unemployment will remain below 5%. This can happen because labor will be earning less than the rate of inflation. S that workers collectively will have less real income, which will be the cause of the recession. I don't think the recession will be cataclysmic like in '08 and '09 where government spending has been enormous in the past two years. We don't have the private sector excesses that can cause a deep and extended recession. I know I have changed my view the Fed in the past year and a half, but that's because eight months ago the Fed finally became serious about fighting inflation and they are now on the path to a slowing economy and reduced inflation.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 3, \"speaker\": \"Jim Tisch\", \"section_number\": 5, \"uuid\": \"1969cbcd-4631-45b5-89e2-57283bb2a318\", \"speaker_title\": \"Chief Executive Officer at Loews\"}"}, {"id": 15, "text": "As, I said, I feel a pause in tightening in short-term rates at the beginning of 2023 is warranted and hopefully the Fed won't be Badger into excess of tightening, which could have serious negative ramifications for the economy.
