So for the quarter, you can see what we've presented on our walk forward that our pricing so far, which, just as a reminder, is fully in at the beginning of January. We're anniversary-ing our last price announcement coming up here in November. So pricing has been into the market for a while. In the quarter, you can see we're covering costs, well covering costs plus our margin. We have seen steel costs moderate a bit. Over time, we typically see some fade on pricing as costs moderate. I want to just kind of remind everybody, though, that it's not just steel costs that we have as part of our pricing portfolio, it's also material cost. We've seen a broader basket of costs go up over time. And those costs have been pretty resilient. So with the lower volumes as we came into the third quarter, we're carrying a little extra inventory. We're a little bit more on safety stock than typical. Some of that is at a bit higher cost, including higher steel costs as we're working through buying still a little bit in advance of some of the volumes. And so we'll see an improvement in the fourth quarter, we expect on margin. Part of that is related to the price cost relationship.
