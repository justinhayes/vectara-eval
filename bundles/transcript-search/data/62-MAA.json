I'd say we've certainly seen cap rates come up here in the third quarter as we've seen interest rates really rise very quickly. Now interest rates are regularly over 6%. We don't have a whole lot of data points frankly, in the third quarter. Second quarter, we commented we saw cap rates in the 37% range. For what we did see close in the third quarter, call it, 4.5% is really where we saw cap rates. But again, not a whole lot of trades there. And I would say that what we've seen -- for what has traded is there's been some characteristic about the property really that has allowed the buyer really to take advantage frequently of previous debt rates through loan assumptions, while taking advantage of the rent profile today. So I would say that what has traded so far, in my opinion, is not reflective of where the market is going. Most of what we're hearing today is new assets that are being priced. BOVs are going out today 5% or more in terms of the cap rate. So I would expect to see cap rates rise from where they are today. Where they shake out, that's hard to say. But given where interest rates are, over 6%, given where we are starting to see seasonality come back into play, which we did in last year. The appetite for a significant level of negative leverage from a buyer's perspective, I think that appetite is dissipating a bit. So my sense is that we'll continue to see cap rates rise a bit next year. But I think it will be mid next year before we really start to see some transactions come to market and transactions to clear. So I think it's going to take some time to really get visibility into what that looks like.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"A.Bradley Hill\", \"section_number\": 2, \"uuid\": \"f4f58ecf-f1f3-4536-9430-4bb1ee6bfe56\", \"speaker_title\": \"Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer at Mid-America Apartment Communities\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Nick Joseph", "id": 5, "section": [{"id": 6, "text": "That's very helpful.

I mean I'll back up and just start with, we have purposefully sat out of the acquisition market over the last couple of years. The last deal we purchased was in 2019 because really the spreads between development yield and acquisition cap rates had gotten really large over the last few years. So we have purposefully focused our capital on development. Where we sit today with cap rates of 4.5%, perhaps moving up to 5%, I think you're going to get back to a more normal 100, 125, 150 basis point spread between cap rates and development yields. So I think there'll need to be some movement going forward. And all of that is really dependent upon the quality of the development that you have where it's located, what the rent trajectory looks like on that asset. But clearly, I think for starts going into next year on the development side, I think you're likely to see a drop off in the construction starts. Developers, we obviously are active in the JV market partnering with developers. We are certainly hearing that equity partners on deals are backing out. Some of the pipeline, I think, is shrinking as you go forward from here because those yields do need to go up a bit. So we're hopeful at this point that some of that starts to manifest itself through construction costs. But as you know, just like land costs, it's a little sticky.

What I would tell you is that as we start to think about the next year 2023, I'm pretty encouraged still about our ability to continue to drive top line performance that's going to be well above our long-term averages. As Tim alluded to, based on where we sit today, we think the earn-in to next year based on the rent trajectories that we've captured over the last number of months is baked in next year is going to be 6% and then you start to think about what sort of market rent growth we're going to get on top of that next year. And as we sit here today and think about the drivers of demand surrounding the employment markets, the stress of single-family affordability and these net continued positive migration trends that we see across our markets, we continue to see an expectation lease I have a positive rent growth next year on top of the earn-in that we're getting. Now there is more discussion surrounding the prospects for a recession. I think generally, the thought at the moment is that if it happens, it tends to be -- it will likely be not particularly severe and not particularly prolonged. Certainly, that's the hope we have. And we also are hearing that the idea that it's going to have a huge negative effect on the labor market, in the employment market in general, is not likely to occur. So who knows exactly what's going to happen. But as we sit here today, we continue to feel pretty positive about the outlook going into next year. And we are -- there are a lot of things that we're doing to prepare for the potential for a more negative outlooks, particularly pushing rent growth is something that we always do as we think we may be heading into a downturn. Of course, the balance sheet is in really great shape, and we're keeping a lot of capacity available to deal with opportunities that might emerge in a more recessionary environment. And we think that we're going to be well positioned for whatever we likely are going to see next year.

So in the land basis of those, as I mentioned, we've been very disciplined in picking sites and we've lost out on sites because, one, the location wasn't the best location in a market and ones that are likely to stress more if things get a little bit shaky in the economy or the land price was too high.

Just for perspective, in the acquisition side of things, after the last recession for a three-year period, 2010 to '12, we executed on almost 10,000 units, single transactions, 9,500 units.

And as you mentioned, the cost to refinance that, the cost to extend loans, banks are not going to be willing to do that. They want to clear these loans off their books at this point.

So as we talked about, really in our portfolio, Texas, Florida and even Georgia, they are the primary areas of our taxes and our pressure that we've been saying together. They're somewhere around probably a little bit over 2/3 of our tax cost. And the primary pressure comes from Texas and Florida that you just mentioned. And so for the full year, that certainly we're looking at Texas is probably a little over half of that 2/3. So you see the significance there. We spend a lot of time working on challenging the values as we talked about when we're from informal to formal. So a lot of pressure on that. I think -- and so -- the change this quarter though was really about information coming in, in Florida. We got a lot of information late and they typically do that and it caused us to believe that the values were a little higher than we thought they were going to be in Florida and the miller rates so we're seeing rollbacks not quite what we're expecting.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Albert M.

As we look into next year, I think it's important to think about there's two main components you got to look at one -- it's obviously a backward-looking process. And so you're going to have one positive impact maybe the change in cap rate environment that we talked about that this morning. But the other side is they're looking at a really strong top line revenue growth this year when they set the values. So both those coming together, what we would say is as we look forward next year probably looks a lot like this year with maybe a little bit of upward bias because of that strong revenue performance. But as we move into 2024, and pass some of the comments Brad was saying on the acquisitions and development, you would expect that the things settle down and we make a little bit of moderation at that point because of the stabilized cap rate and rent growth environments.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 2, \"speaker\": \"Albert M.

Really, in the -- from the underwriting perspective because of the seasonality we're seeing that didn't see earlier this year, I suspect when they go back in at this point, and get construction cost price updates they may not increase quite as much as they have been, but their rent growth when they update those at this point is showing seasonality.

So we've got, as I mentioned earlier, a number of properties between four to six that we can start next year. Those will probably be weighted mid to late next year is my sense.

So we've got some time under our belt from that. But as I mentioned in my comments, we have the ability to be patient on those. -- and the discipline that we use to help us find sites and really underwriting our deals will also be the same discipline that we use in determining when we -- when is the right time to start construction on these assets.
