Could you kind of give us a characterization of what you guys see as the pipeline of potential projects and opportunities that are coming directly from federal funds? And on the second question -- my next question would be, on the comment regarding longer procurement cycles. And I think what's a little bit intriguing about you guys making this comment is that it seems to be that there is a significant amount of federal funds being allocated to local governments, federal government and several other branches. And you think that with those funds being allocated and the speed of those allocations that are now starting to accelerate, do you think that lead times and procurement cycles would actually start to either stay the same or compress.

Let me start, and Brian jump in. First, on the ARPA deal, that was a really nice deal for a lot of reasons. As I mentioned in my comments, that was Hidalgo County, Texas. It was a full enterprise public safety suite deal, enforcement mobile civil process. ARPA funds were certainly a factor in getting that deal signed and funded. It's about $1.25 million license deal and about a $450,000 ARR deal. I think also what's interesting about that is that's a deal that also where our Tyler Alliance story really helped close the deal. So some of the strategic things that we've been talking about are -- again, are continuing to resonate with our clients. It's also interesting because it's an AWS Gov cloud deployment, which is continuing.

We track ARPA Funds. It's sometimes it's not easy to always identify specific deals tied to ARPA Funds because a lot of times these funds may be used for other things, which then free up funds for deals that we're pursuing. We see ARPA funds more often in areas where they are more like singular purchases. We expect to see some, for example, in school bus transportation deal where they're purchasing a large amount of hardware or something like that. The comment on longer procurement cycles, I don't want that to be taken out of context really. I think our cycles generally are on track with where they've been. I think the comment was really meant to say, as we're looking at more and more cross-sell opportunities through NIC and as those deals are getting larger, some of those larger deals are taking a little bit longer, but I wouldn't characterize procurement cycles across the Tyler portfolio of products is actually getting longer.
