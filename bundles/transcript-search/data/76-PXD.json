We are signing like, as you mentioned, are power purchase agreements to take that power and based on where the forward curve on the electricity market looks like, these are at favorable prices to that. So, we're excited to get those projects on and get the benefit of power purchase agreement pricing. So, they're good pricing as the way we look at it.
