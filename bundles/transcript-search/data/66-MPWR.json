Michael, my second question is on the topic of China, and over the last, I'd say three or four weeks since some of the new commerce and BIS restrictions have come into place, I've been getting a ton of investor questions about this topic with relation to your company on two fronts. I guess the first being, MPS has a significant employee base in China. If you could maybe quantify what maybe percentage of your employees and in what functions are actually in China, and if you've heard from any of these restrictions that there could be any restrictions on those employees need to relocate anybody, those kind of things? And then the second part of the question is on your manufacturing footprint. I know it's spread across China, Taiwan, increasingly in Korea. We've heard some stories from semi cap companies needing to pull employees out of SMIC for example, in other places because of these new restrictions. So anything in your manufacturing operations that might be disrupted at all because of some of the China restrictions and how far are you guys along or maybe the mix of your capacity that's now outside of China. You get this nature of the questions, but they've been a pretty frequent and acute over the last three or four weeks. So, it would be great if you could just kind of address some of those topics.

We don't have to have the people to leave -- Americans have to leave an MPS office within China and that's not in the sanction entity list, and we are not in a sanction entity list. And other one is the manufacturing in the last couple of quarters, we already talked about it. We've diversified out of China and we're starting five, six years ago. Also, I should mention that we thought about it on the engineering manpower. This MPS started at 2017, and we are in Barcelona now.
