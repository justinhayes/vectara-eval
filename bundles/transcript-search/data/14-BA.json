Our BDS portfolio, the 85% of the business is doing pretty well. It's these fixed-price development programs that unfortunately we're working our way through. We had it count for recent performance, including a reassessment of our forecast cost complete. There's no doubt about it. The biggest impact was the tanker as you mentioned. At $1.2 billion, it was driven by two things. The supply-chain constraints and specifically part shortages had been persisting, and they likely will persist longer than we had contemplated. And then two, this labor instability. As you know, all airplane programs contemplate a learning curve improvement over time. And we adjusted our assumptions, because labor stability is an issue that is likely to continue into the future. We can hire, it's getting the workforce trained and up to speed that we had to account for in this particular period. We applied the similar framework to the VC-25B where the labor stability issues are magnified because of the requirement to get secured -- security clearances. And that's also contributed to schedule shifts. So, those are the two big ones. And it's just, at this moment, the provision reflects what we think is likely to happen in front of us. The other bucket really relates to, what I would call, true development which is MQ-25, T-7 and Commercial Crew. We did adjust for similar macro constraints where needed, but there's also a recognition, there is technical challenges that we're working those through and sometimes impact schedule.
