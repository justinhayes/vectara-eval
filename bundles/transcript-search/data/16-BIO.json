Thank you, Brandon. Obviously, when we raised the last the bond with probably a great timing. Today, the [Indecipherable] treasury is above the coupon that we pay. It takes time to catch up. Specifically, if you think about the bonds, it was about $11 million of an expense for the quarter, and this specific quarter was about $8 million of interest income, but it continues to catch up as we will continue to roll the investments. So it should get within the next one to two quarters, assuming that these interest rates will continue to be out there, at least into kind of parity between the two could also be kind of moving into a gain there.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Ilan Daskal\", \"section_number\": 42, \"uuid\": \"b29b5e23-7aeb-4e9a-badf-c28331d1fa79\", \"speaker_title\": \"Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer at Bio-Rad Laboratories\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Brandon Couillard", "id": 79, "section": [{"id": 80, "text": "Thanks.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Brandon Couillard\", \"section_number\": 43, \"uuid\": \"d54b2ce1-7ff2-4d78-9a2b-2529afeac61a\", \"speaker_title\": \"Analyst at Jefferies\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Ilan Daskal", "id": 81, "section": [{"id": 82, "text": "Thank you.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Ilan Daskal\", \"section_number\": 44, \"uuid\": \"f30a0100-69e1-4a25-9aba-a70e348b7aa1\", \"speaker_title\": \"Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer at Bio-Rad Laboratories\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Jack Meehan", "id": 83, "section": [{"id": 84, "text": "Thanks.

Very similar to sort of the conversation that we had last quarter in that there are two dynamics.

At a high level, though, demand remains strong. And if we look at sort of the core clinical testing growth, it is demand is very much in line with pre-pandemic levels.
