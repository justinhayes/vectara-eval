Just wanted to go back to Bob, your answer to Lisa's question in the Q&A. The free cash flow conversion, I think you said likely to remain below 100% going forward.

So just wanted to kind of calibrate this. I mean if revenue growth moves back to the high single-digit range from the current low double-digit run rate, does that mean that free cash flow conversion goes back north of 100%?
