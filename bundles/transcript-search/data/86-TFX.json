Thanks. I guess I have two questions. I'll just go and give to you both now. So first, with UroLift, with regard to the sales force, has there been any changes, disruption, turnover in that sales force? Have you added headcount this year? And then the second question is just on Standard Bariatrics, is this -- I mean, I totally understand the opportunity on the sleeve gastrectomy market and bariatrics, but is this sort of a platform technology that would enable you to offer like a full range of stapling products over time to kind of enter that duopoly market?", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Michael Matson\", \"section_number\": 57, \"uuid\": \"f079ba9a-711a-48c7-830a-68466a89915a\", \"speaker_title\": \"Analyst at Needham & Company\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Liam J.
