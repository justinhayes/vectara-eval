We saw it in China, even though we had growth in China which was respectable and in Japan also but we saw the market impact in those 2 areas, too. I felt great about it's a smaller part of the business but Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and other businesses that were up significantly but our major 3 were still affected, primarily the 3 is Australia and China and Japan with some COVID issues.

I think when you talk about first quarter to second quarter, the rhythm that we had there, remember, the normal rhythms we've seen in this business, is seasonality, we call it. We have not seen that since really 2019. And so we had muted signals on teens through 2020, '21. Just -- it wasn't the same. What I liked about -- what I saw in the third quarter was we saw teens come back in the sense of in a pattern of what you'd expect in teen season, Q3, Q4. It's too early for me to dig out the data and tell you how much share we're gaining against wires and brackets. Well, Jon, we don't talk about a lot or products like -- and we highlighted it here today, when you look at the Invisalign First product line, we're really getting tremendous results out there on young patients, 6 to 9 years old, the Phase I, Phase II treatments, where often the Phase II can be a lot less extensive than what the Phase I was with wires and brackets. So our different extension devices, so we see a big uptake in that product line from a teen standpoint. We see that as penetration too. We've seen consistent growth from a share standpoint in those teen cases in Americas globally. So -- we just introduced curved wings mandibular advancement too that's having a really good start in the market, too, to address some cases that mandibular advancement couldn't get in the past. So Jon both with technology, with our advertising campaigns, the teen packs and whatever, I continue to feel good about our movement.

I mean we did fairly well in -- from a European standpoint. But third quarter in Europe is never a particularly strong quarter, we're going to pull a signal out of. When you look at the United States, you go to Gaidge data. And you'll see that inside Gaidge Data aligners were down but Invisalign was actually above what the generic aligners are reported in Gaidge data which says we continue to do well with our teen portfolio and what we do. You see wires and brackets cases actually expanded. But what that is, is you see if they're doing more -- fewer adults -- and you know how orthos have held on to teens for a long time, you get a mix phenomenon there where it looks like they're doing more wires and brackets but they're not. They're just doing fewer adults and they mix down in that sense. So -- and then move over to Asia, I've always felt good about Asia is different by country. But the COVID overlay in Japan in particular but also China. I thought the teen case volume was still reasonable. But it's still hard to pull a signal out of a lot of noise with the COVID shutdowns in all of those countries. So again, just like in John's question, Jeff, is I do feel great about our portfolio. I feel good about how we're positioning the product. I think the teen packs are a way to sell the way doctors want to commit in this area, I think we'll continue to get strong there.
