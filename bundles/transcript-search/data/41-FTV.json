So it doesn't mean it's going to happen exactly like we think it is from a time frame perspective but we're not seeing things fall out yet which I think is good news for the -- into '23 for sure.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"James Lico\", \"section_number\": 68, \"uuid\": \"87b0fd94-9ac3-48e8-bbe8-c40398b330f5\", \"speaker_title\": \"President & Chief Executive Officer at Fortive\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by James Lico", "id": 130, "section": [{"id": 131, "text": "Well, thanks, Dennis.

We're really proud of the quarter we just had. I think it demonstrates the power and the resiliency of the portfolio.
