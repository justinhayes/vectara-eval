One is going to be essentially what you're referring to which is our current debt structure -- net debt structure. So the cash the debt, whether it's variable or fixed and then the interest effect on that both as interest income and interest outflow. But secondly, we do have some FX volatility that always occurs in our interest line. Some is related to the derivatives we have on intercompany loans, this would be the points that you may have that move up and down based on currencies.
