We think that -- what we know is that the higher lapse rates are primarily in policy years 1 through 3. Once we get past that, the lapses are either at or near the historical levels. We think one reason for that is people that bought policies in 2020, '21, with COVID down less, they may think they don't need the coverage. We think that's certainly a factor. But also, we think that inflation is having some impact as well. But if we look back in the past history, if we look back into 2010, '11 period, when it was a down economy, we had a little bit of a spike in lapses there but it didn't last long. This spike isn't as much as what we experienced back then and we think too that at some point it will get back to what we call normal lapses.

But just as you try to rectify kind of -- and you talk about stair-step, so it felt like this quarter with the drop-off in producer count was a step backward. And I think Larry was talking about different incentives in terms of retention. Is there any color maybe you could provide around those incentives just so that we could get a sense of how it might influence the producer count.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Andrew Kligerman\", \"section_number\": 38, \"uuid\": \"c0696b33-1f74-4978-8f2d-da884aa5c239\", \"speaker_title\": \"Analyst at Credit Suisse\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Larry Hutchison", "id": 67, "section": [{"id": 68, "text": "Again, I want to point out that the currently strong quarter-over-quarter, actually there's a 7% increase in number of recruits. The terminations were a little bit of a surprise, higher than expected. I think that goes hand in hand with the fact that we haven't had middle management growth. And so when you change those incentives, you're not increasing compensation, you're shifting compensation to affect behavior. What you kind of do is encourage your middle managers to better train those new recruits. And what's a better training, there's more activity and the training is just how to sell but encouraging greater activity with those new recruits and agents. As there's greater activity, better training, they make more money because they have higher sales levels and retain more agents. And so again, the color is this. If you look at -- let's compare Family Heritage to American Income. In the first quarter, they had pretty slow sales. As they shifted some of their compensation there, they had an emphasis on recruiting and developing middle managers. They have 5% to 8% middle managers for the year with a 13% increase in sales this quarter. But American Income, again, has a little bit of a tough comparable because there was a 20% increase in the agency force in '20 and '21. So with the stair-step, when you have that kind of a record increase, you expect to have some leveling of recruiting. And again, I have every confidence American Income will grow but the focus will be on developing leadership, developing more middle managers and the growth will come as they develop one middle management.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Larry Hutchison\", \"section_number\": 39, \"uuid\": \"bf81a445-115f-4cef-b858-50e807f4a605\", \"speaker_title\": \"Co-Chairman & Chief Executive Officer at Globe Life\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Andrew Kligerman", "id": 69, "section": [{"id": 70, "text": "So there's some type of a compensation for doing more training.

Those 3 to 4 agents are trained but they're also encouraged to review the data with these producing agents, how many presentations do they make in a week, what's the monthly average, what's the average premium. And as middle managers study that data, they know what needs to be addressed? Is it a training issue, is it an activity issue, is it a closing issue? And so those are all factors. And it really changes agent by agent. So when we say American Income, it has been a little flat in their recruiting or their agent growth. Remember, there's 99 offices within American Income. Some of the locations have had an outstanding year. They've had good growth. And so again, with the sales leadership that is in American income, they're identifying those offices that have not done so well. And then we'll work with them to provide them data with respect to the middle managers, what's the success of the middle managers, what's the success of the agents.

As we do the different campaigns, we look at those costs, we look at the test and we see a 10% decrease, as example, mailings as a result of the analytics. So that reflects the cost increase in both postage and paper. I guess the response rates out of that is the null effect. And really, what you look at is, if you look at the cost of the investment within that campaign, what is the expected response rate and from that, what's the expected issue rate. If you're not meeting those expectations in the test, then you reduce those mailings. So it's not -- if you're going to look at postage costs of 5%, you'll probably reduce something 5%. It's at the end of that process of the analytics and the campaigns to determine what your volumes are going to be in all the way affects what your sales level will be. I want to make a point there, too, that direct response, it's not just an issue really of spending more money to increase sales, because the profitability of an increase in sales is a function of the cost of acquiring the business. And so if you spend more money, it's not going to necessarily indicate higher response rates and the response rate doesn't go up with additional spending. So again, when you think about direct response, I think about that differently than agency. Your acquisition cost is on the front end and not the back end of the sales process.
