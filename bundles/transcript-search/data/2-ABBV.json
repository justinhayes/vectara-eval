One is, how will the biosimilars priced, that will certainly have some impact, we won't know that until we actually get into the market and start to see some of that activity.

There are various kinds of contracts that we use in some cases there are penalties or repercussions that would have to come into consideration if a contract got reopened at some point in time, they're not all like that, but many are like that.

And that's key and I would say there's two factors that are most important around that. The first is, that Skyrizi and Rinvoq grow fast enough that they can more than offset that they can essentially grow through all of the erosion that occurs on Humira and deliver incremental performance above and beyond that.

A couple of questions please. First on Imbruvica, I'm assuming that Imbruvica is going to be included in the top 10 CMS list for price negotiation on the Medicare next year. I'm assuming that's correct, when we think about the impact on net pricing for Imbruvica, do you anticipate net pricing coming under pressure throughout 2026 given the contracting that's expecting to take place among your competitors to secure formally positions given the catastrophic coverage burden on PBMs post the IRA implementation. So, is the impact going to get put forward for the class including for Imbruvica before you actually get the price cut coming?", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Andrew Baum\", \"section_number\": 30, \"uuid\": \"5c1d7ca9-3211-4da1-a70f-aaddcfc33ab0\", \"speaker_title\": \"Analyst at Citigroup\"}"}, {"id": 61, "text": "And then second, with Epcoritamab, there has been some interesting data on the importance a profound T-cell depletion in lupus using CAR-T assets, and CD20 bispecific could get to a similar level.

The most important thing to me and to the Board is to make sure that the business is performing exactly as we expect going forward and we're not going to make any transition until we've gone through the biosimilar event, and we're confident in the performance of the overall business. That would be the appropriate time once we're confident to make a transition at that point.

The one thing I would add that as you think about even under a scenario where if we did get to some kind of a step at it, you have to go back and remember that most of these mechanisms, most patients fail, and they fail at a relatively high-level and over a relatively short period of time. So, even if you had to rotate through, you're going to get to second line relatively quickly, and recycling somebody back through another TNF typically doesn't work very well for those patients. And I'd say the demand now with kind of agents that we have on the market now and the level of remission that they can create, the demand among physicians is much higher to get patients into remission as rapidly as they possibly can. And so, I think all of those dynamics tell us that this model should continue to work over the long-haul.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Richard A.
