I cover the automotive industry here at Bank of America, for those of you that don't know me. We're very happy to have a number of members or three members of Ford's management team here, to run through some of the highlights from the third quarter and get into some real good future trends and answers hopefully, around those future trends, beyond the third quarter that will drive Ford's, what we call, core to future transition and I think there's a lot of progress being made there and a lot of nuggets that came out during the third quarter reporting.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"John Murphy\", \"section_number\": 0, \"uuid\": \"11bd11fb-7c6a-45b5-923a-60aaa841bfeb\", \"speaker_title\": \"Analyst at Bank of America\"}"}, {"id": 3, "text": "We're happy to have John Lawler, Chief Financial Officer and Interim Supply Chain Officer, two very important jobs at Ford and really hot topics at the moment themselves; Lisa Drake, Vice President, EV Industrialization for Ford Model 8, so, obviously, another really hot seat, not just inside of Ford, but in the industry at large; and Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director, Investor Relations and I'd be remiss if I didn't say happy birthday to Lynn. I think she's celebrating her 23rd or 24th birthday today. So we really enjoy and appreciate all Lynn's efforts and answers for us, and I would sing happy birthday, but everybody, I think, on the line would drop off. So happy birthday, Lynn, and thanks for all the help.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 2, \"speaker\": \"John Murphy\", \"section_number\": 0, \"uuid\": \"11bd11fb-7c6a-45b5-923a-60aaa841bfeb\", \"speaker_title\": \"Analyst at Bank of America\"}"}]}], "title": "Opening Remarks for F (Ford Motor) on 10/27/22 1:00 PM ET", "metadata_json": "{\"company_name\": \"Ford Motor\", \"company_ticker\": \"F\", \"transcript_date\": \"10/27/22 1:00 PM ET\", \"section_type\": \"Opening Remarks\", \"transcript_url\": \"https://www.marketbeat.com/earnings/transcripts/82680/\"}"}
