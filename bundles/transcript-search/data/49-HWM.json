And as we know, the anticipated engine builds were not as high as -- the actual is not as high as anticipated.

Asset returns this year are lighter and lower than last year and I don't have the exact numbers to hand, that will be a negative for that situation. And then when you put two together is that along with the cash contributions we have made, we have a net liability reduction. And my anticipation is that we'll show further reduction of liability in the fourth quarter to make a meaningful change in the reduction of those legacy liabilities. And I think on a net basis, we're probably down to I mean, I guess, around $700 million-ish plus or minus, so it's a pretty diminish number for the company now, very different than it was two or three years ago.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"John C.

So if you compare to where we are today, we've improved around $85 million in terms of net liability. A lot of that's driven by actions we started taking to clip off gross liabilities going back to Q2 of 2020 believe it or not, when we took out some U.K. buyout programs. But from Q2 of 2020 to current, we've taken off about $600 million of actions, right?

We get a nice favorability around discount rates because discount rates have moved from around 2.7% at the end of last year to mid 5% right now. So you're going to get a nice good guy on the liability side. To your point, the assets, if you even just track the S&P 500, they will be negative. You pushed the two of them together, though, you're going to get a nice reduction in terms of net liability.

So when I think about the environment we're in where interest rates are going up rapidly and it's possible this week we'll see a further 75 basis points increase in federal funds rate, I mean that generally is bad news for most companies.

And so we should be set for maybe uniquely as a sector set for growth for the next two or three years and that growth should come through and our balance sheet should improve as a result of the interest rate movement.
