Thanks for taking the question. Congratulations as well on the quarter. I wanted to ask a little bit more of a technical question. As we think about 400 gig and you think about the traction you're seeing with your Cloud Titans as well as some of the specialty cloud guys, I'm just curious if you could level set us on where you think we're at in terms of the 400-gig cycle? And on that topic as well, any updated thoughts on this idea of the AI Fabric networks representing an incremental adjacent growth driver for your business at the Cloud Titans? Thank you.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Aaron Rakers\", \"section_number\": 87, \"uuid\": \"6bc0d77f-fea0-47ec-993c-5bd3940a91e7\", \"speaker_title\": \"Analyst at Wells Fargo\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Jayshree V.

Just to level set on the numbers, you may recall that we had 70 or so customers in 2020. We doubled to 300 into 2021. And if I had to guess, I would say we double again in 2022 in terms of 400-gig customers. But the important thing to remember here is that they are not just 400. There really are a permutation and combination of multiple speeds, multiple use cases. And together, they are an important contributor, but it's never an isolation 100. Some of them are uplinks, some of them are native connections. Some of them, as Anshul alluded, are DCI routing solutions.
