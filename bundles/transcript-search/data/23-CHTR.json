So I'm just hoping that you and Chris can walk through the strategy behind the Spectrum One promotion and the financial impact relative to your prior promotional strategies. And then separately, Chris, I know it's early, and you're indicating that you're going to update us in December. Like how broadly are you considering, be it all the strategy shifts, obviously investors are kind of combination of nervous and excited about changes that might take place? I mean, is there scope to rapidly accelerate capital spending or different pricing strategies? How wide is the net here in terms of what you're considering? Is this revolution or evolution?

But Spectrum One packages seamless connectivity with our products, and they all work better together. It's offered at a first-year promotional price. And as a result, our pricing of the underlying products, whether that's Internet, advanced WiFi and mobile, it has not changed. Even after that promotional period, Spectrum One creates values for customers in a way that our competitors really can't replicate. It's pretty similar to what was the design of Tom's original triple-play. And we also attach additional products or mobile lines to that promotional sell-in.

[Speech Overlap] Yeah, I guess sticking with the wireless theme and the network, Chris, last quarter, you were willing to highlight to us that maybe we on the sell-side had got the wireless economics wrong. Obviously, you've gotten -- you've got the Spectrum One plan in the market, which seems to be doing what you hoped it would, which is drive faster growth. I'm sure we'll see more of that in Q4. The losses in wireless, and I know product P&Ls are of limited use to some extent. But they look like they'll be pretty flattish year-on-year this year. I'm just wondering is there anyway you can sort of take us into the cost structure on the wireless side, speak to the network offload opportunities? And is there any way to help us think about -- as you continue down this convergence path, is there a timeline towards EBITDA starting to inflect and really benefit from the wireless revenue scale you're building? Because it sounds like -- looks like we're not going to see that at least in the near-term. And then I'm just wondering what are the returns you're seeing on the high-split activity so far? And you mentioned DOCSIS 4.0, Tom did in his prepared remarks.

The first one I'm sure you saw, this is our best quarter yet for mobile growth and we continue to have additional sort of customer acquisition costs, because of that, that weigh on mobile EBITDA. Also, we did see both in mobile and in the cable side increases in bad debt in the year-over-year. And so there is some of that that's impacting mobile EBITDA. And we did implement a new system early on in the year, I think Tom has talked about it. And we're still sort of working through the last of the costs related to having implemented that system, and so there's a little weight there that I think will come down as we settle in a bit more. But the key here is that you should know that gross margin in the mobile product continues to be very good. And as Chris mentioned, Spectrum One, while it offers a promotional price on mobile, we're both selling additional lines in with that promotional offer, and at our rack rate which that rolls to in 12 months.

What they essentially do is give you the opportunity to increase downstream speeds and upstream speeds significantly, and to offer products symmetrically at pretty low capital costs. When we did DOCSIS 3.1, you remember we spent about $9 on past, not counting CPE, and which was $450 million approximately to get the plant ready. This is going to cost a little more than that, but it's still a relatively low-cost capital investment that gives you a significant increase in capacity. And that leaves you in a pathway where you can continue to invest with additional technologies, including DOCSIS 4.0 to even further enhance the capability of the network at a pretty capital-efficient way that gives you massive capacity and moves us to the 10G world we've been talking about over time. And as a general concept, it takes away additional operating costs as well -- and additional capital costs when you make these investments, because the augmentation in the network that you have to do for growth -- I talked in my prepared remarks about how much capacity people are using, and that capacity use continues to go up. So this -- and we have a normal capital budget associated with that growth in capacity. And when you do these spectrum split upgrades, you get that capacity included with that investment. So, you don't have to make the augmentation investment. So it's a very efficient way of ubiquitously deploying lots of capability across your entire footprint.

You're obviously doing a lot at the edges of your network that would I think give you good insight into labor costs and the implications of cost of capital. What are you seeing both for you and would you suspect for fiber overbuilders that are competitors? And does it have any implications for how you think about the RDOF build?

I chose that date two years ago, because it was the 50th anniversary of my beginning in cable as a technician, working my way through college in 1972. So, it had a personal meaning to me, and I thought it was a milestone a couple of years ago that I might want to exercise.

And -- but on the other hand, I was -- I love this business and I love what the future is for this business. And there is tremendous opportunity.

And they're significant, but we've -- our strategy from a pricing and packaging perspective is to be the value provider and to make these products work together at lower prices and create good value for consumers and to use our ability to drive market share as the primary driver of our revenue. But that said, we have been passing through video price increases, and we passed through recently a broadband price increase. And it was a result of the inflationary pressures that we've seen. At the same time, it doesn't negate the way our primary revenue opportunity is developing, which is to create more customers faster, and to create those customers with more products associated with each connection, so that our ARPU and revenue go up together.

I think Jessica mentioned in her prepared remarks our view on core capital intensity, in terms of outlook, and she wouldn't have said that if we didn't collectively believe that was the case now and going forward. So she mentioned excluding rural and that there may be some lumpiness as it relates to timing of exactly how you get high-split, supply chain, and inventory and all that, but the core capital intensity is -- it continues to decline. The leverage target, I heard that rumor out in the marketplace that I find it a little bit funny, because I've been at 4.5x since Switzerland, since Germany, since Charter, 4.5x had a levered equity strategy for a really long time, probably over 20 years. And I helped put that together here at Charter, and we have good growth. And the interest rates aren't all that different, in fact they're probably less for us as Charter today than when I got here at Charter.

It doesn't mean that we don't do fiber. We do fiber on the increment. There may be portions in the network longer term that we decide it's economical to do that, but for the most part, and in fact in its entirety, the path that Tom laid out is the path that we're [Technical Issues] and we're not -- I don't see any reason why somebody would want to go do a full fiber overbuild of a perfectly otherwise good network that can be upgraded at dramatically lower costs and have the same capabilities.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Christopher Winfrey\", \"section_number\": 24, \"uuid\": \"77413b51-89a4-4a1d-a923-f940b2065996\", \"speaker_title\": \"Chief Operating Officer at Charter Communications\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Jessica Fischer", "id": 46, "section": [{"id": 47, "text": "On the rural side, I guess on your first question, the contribution to broadband subs, certainly we are seeing broadband subs coming in off of the rural build that we're executing already.

The fact that we have mobility associated with our broadband products now in a combined product really means that you have very-high priced mobile products with very small usage bandwidth basis.
