Do you see the portfolio with lenacapavir resulting in, I guess, a number of different combos that serve different segments of the market, or is it more likely you're going to end up with one of these combos that really separates from the other and becomes an anchor type asset like we see with Biktarvy?", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Chris Schott\", \"section_number\": 1, \"uuid\": \"4652c19f-bb80-4249-9b66-a7e385b0d931\", \"speaker_title\": \"Analyst at JPMorgan\"}"}]}, {"title": "Remarks by Merdad Parsey", "id": 3, "section": [{"id": 4, "text": "Hi Chris, this is Merdad. Let me first start by saying that we are really excited about the recent approval for lenacapavir in this -- in the highly treatment-experienced population. Obviously, that's a group of people who have limited options and I think lenacapavir as a new class provides a new opportunity for them. In terms of islatravir, what we like about islatravir is that it is fairly late in its development. We are able to be in Phase 2 with that. And I think it provides us a relatively near-term opportunity to launch a partner in treatment for lenacapavir that could be given in a long-acting way. And I think that's really important in terms of where the market is going and what our goal is in terms of, as we've said before, providing a long-acting parenteral option that is longer than in the 3 months or longer time frame. And we're optimistic about our ability to do that.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Merdad Parsey\", \"section_number\": 2, \"uuid\": \"d7faeeb7-fc0c-4e53-b928-8ad09e353442\", \"speaker_title\": \"Chief Medical Officer at Gilead Sciences\"}"}, {"id": 5, "text": "So for that, we have our internal pipeline assets that are really providing our options there.

And right now is a potential certainly islatravir is an option there and we have other options in our pipeline that could potentially get that -- get to that level. So, the way I look at it, just to answer directly your last question, we do think that there will be a lenacapavir partner and there will be probably one partner that will achieve our therapeutic goals in oral, potentially a different partner in parenteral. And as we go forward, if we can make improvements whether that's lenacapavir and being able to provide even longer than six-month therapy or to the partner that we could extend the duration of therapy with a different molecule or a different formulation, we'll always try to get to that longer exposure.

And in the treatment setting, it is clear that you will always have a market for that daily oral which we believe Biktarvy has really set the standard there.

And I'm curious, is it something you guys are looking to take to a final judgment, or would you be open to a settlement? And that brings me to sort of the second part, Andy, how much of a legal charge have you taken on this litigation to date? Because I know you've been doing that on the Biktarvy and other indications in litigation in the past. And is there something more significant that has to happen for a more prominent charge to show up? I ask because every company handles the accounting differently. So, I was just curious.

Thanks, Dan. Hi Umer, thanks for the question. Happy to touch base on this. This is a topic, as you know, that we've been getting a lot of questions on with the Zantac litigation. So a number of things that I can provide some background and context. So first of all, like most companies, anyone operating in the U.S., we are routinely managing a lot of different litigation matters, as you know. Many of those are from our perspective, meritless or baseless. As a matter of practice, we don't typically -- or usually comment on specific litigation cases. What I can say stepping back is that we have won or resolved the 3 material litigation -- or 3 material litigation matters over the past year, as you know, on terms that were favorable to the Company and to our shareholders, that is the Juno Kite IP litigation, the ViiV IP litigation around bictegravir, then the third was the TAF litigation with generic companies.", "metadata_json": "{\"paragraph_number\": 1, \"speaker\": \"Andrew Dickinson\", \"section_number\": 31, \"uuid\": \"e460f50b-13c5-4419-bc02-ee22e453068a\", \"speaker_title\": \"Chief Financial Officer at Gilead Sciences\"}"}, {"id": 61, "text": "We have an outstanding legal team, both internally and externally. And then maybe to your specific question, I mean, we have complete confidence in the merits of the defense on the ongoing product liability case. So, it is very different than the Zantac litigation case. So just to your question on the number of plaintiffs, for instance, if I remember correctly in the Zantac cases, there were 250,000 patients in our case -- I'm sorry, plantiffs. There were 25,000 in ours. But the key difference is that the issues at hand here, I mean, our TDF-based products are life-saving products that really transform care for HIV. And the side effects of the products were in the label from day one. The labels in the U.S. and Europe were slightly different but the labels were there. These were well known, well disclosed potential side effects. And I think that's an important piece of it. So, it's a very different case. Zantac, as I remember correctly was taken off the market and reformulated. So I'd be careful about drawing too many parallels between what you saw with Zantac and some of the companies that were affected by that in this litigation. That doesn't mean that we don't take it seriously. We do take it very seriously.
