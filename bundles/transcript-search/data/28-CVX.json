And I guess what we noticed is that with only 1 quarter left in the -- left for the year, it looks like you'll be closer to the lower end of the $700,000 to $750,000 guidance range.

I think the thing that some people may miss is during the pandemic, drilled but uncompleted well inventories really grew. And rightfully so, we didn't need to frac wells and bring them online when there was declining demand for the production. So -- and we kept some drilling going. So that inventory grew as we went back to work, the first thing we did was send completion crews out and start to bring the DUCs online.

There's a lot of moving pieces, and I don't know if you're going to talk about this because you'll have to -- you'll release it in a month or so. But the most obvious moving pieces that we see next year are that TCO spend starting to roll off, and some of that will be absorbed by the Permian, which we know is going to garner some more capital next year.

I think those will come back into developments and eventually online which will ease some of these global constraints. But the system is tight right now. And what you see is when you have some maintenance that runs along, some unplanned events, as we've seen on the West Coast, or when you see things like the strike that we've seen in France here recently, markets tighten up really quickly. And that sends a price signal to try to bring supplies in from further away. And so the entire refining complex right now is a little more tightly balanced than it historically has been. And I think in the short term, if you want to call that the next year, plus or minus, probably stays that way, maybe a little bit longer to some degree. And then I think as you see some of this new capacity come online, we get back into a situation where it's not quite as finely balanced as it is today.

Good afternoon and congratulations on the very strong results. My first question, your financial framework is clearly to manage through the cycle.

So my question is, as you look at your Downstream businesses, whether in the U.S. or Asia, have you seen any signs of an economic slowdown which would cause you some concern as you look ahead to 2023 and which might perhaps drive a more conservative approach to capex growth?

Certainly, the U.S. West Coast, which had some refining issues and prices reflected that. We saw gasoline demand in the third quarter, responsive to those higher prices and a little bit of softness there. Diesel demand has been pretty strong around the world, maybe a little less so in China, given some of the lockdowns that they're seeing. And aviation demand has been steadily coming back as people are flying again not quite to pre-COVID levels yet, but steadily increasing. And so overall, I wouldn't say that product demand that we've seen to date is sending a strong signal that a recession is underway or that the economy is significantly slowing.
