If we go back and we look at kind of the progression of what's happened this year, back in March, we -- roughly the March time frame, we saw the consumer market come under pressure. We talked a lot about that. In, let's call it, the June time frame, we saw the PC OEMs really start adjusting their inventory very aggressively. We talked about that last quarter. And we've seen that play out during the quarter now in a number of different fronts. And then just within the last month or 2, we've started to see the big data center operators do the same thing, really sharply adjust their inventory. And obviously, that's factored into our guide. So we've seen this kind of rolling change as it goes through one market to the next. If you look at the other side of it, where are they at in that process, consumer market, we're seeing relatively predictable behavior. It's not like it's at a great point, but it's not falling the way it was. Our ability to predict where it's going to be week-over-week and month-over-month have increased. And so we've got more confidence. We understand where that market is at and how it's going to play out going forward. In the PC market and see Q4, we're actually going to see some sequential growth in units of client SSD, not a huge amount, but it's sequential growth. Again, we talked about a very, very sharp inventory correction. So we're starting to see -- we're getting to the point there where the -- the inventory correction last quarter was quite severe, I mean, when customers going down to less than 10% of their usual demand. Now we see things coming back and stabilizing a little bit. So I don't want to leave you with the impression that things are back up and to the right, but they're stabilizing a bit, and we're starting to see some signs that we're getting more predictable behavior and then that we can then grow out at this point. Obviously, the data center, the big U.S. hyperscalers were just kind of going into that.

I mean, clearly, there'll be some variability from quarter-to-quarter, but we still target that 15% year-over-year. It's a big part, I've talked about this a lot in the past. It's an actual input into the process -- into the design process, not an output. And so we really designed to meet that, and it's a strong part of what we're -- what the whole business is about. HDD margins will be under pressure next quarter. We will have -- as I said before, we'll have some significant underutilization costs that will go into the financials. The other side of that is pricing in nearline and capacity enterprise has been stable, benign about what we expect.
