Vectara has many core features in its Search-as-a-Service platform, and we have unique features that address limitations of current in-market systems. Some of Vectara’s unique differentiators include: (1) 100 % neural search pipeline – encoding, retrieval, and reranking – that delivers a true semantic response for all indexed content and query types. (2) API-first semantic search as a service platform that can be easily set up by any web or application developer in minutes without prior configuration, tuning, or optimization. (3) Intelligent search that eliminates the need for synonyms, stop words, spelling correction, and stemming rules. (4) Cross language search – search an index in a given language with queries from a different language. (4) Operationalization of industry-leading neural network models for ultra-fast and cost-effective search.",
